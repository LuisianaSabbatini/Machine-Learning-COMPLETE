## Introduction to Python

Slide 1: (Introduction): Python Fundamentals

Welcome to this TikTok series on Python fundamentals! Python is a popular, versatile, and beginner-friendly programming language. In this series, we'll cover the basics to help you get started.

Slide 2: Print Statements The print() function is used to display output in Python. It's a great way to start coding and understand how Python works. Code Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Slide 3: Variables

Variables are used to store data in Python. You can assign values to variables and use them later in your code. Code Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("My name is", name, "and I'm", age, "years old.")
```

Slide 4: Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Understanding data types is crucial for writing correct code. Code Example:

```python
num_int = 10
num_float = 3.14
is_true = True
message = "Hello, Python!"
```

Slide 5: Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. Python supports arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators. Code Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3
sum = x + y  # Addition
difference = x - y  # Subtraction
product = x * y  # Multiplication
is_greater = x > y  # Comparison
```

Slide 6: Strings

Strings are sequences of characters used for text manipulation. Python provides various string methods and operations. Code Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, " + name  # Concatenation
length = len(greeting)  # Length of string
upper_case = greeting.upper()  # Convert to uppercase
```

Slide 7: Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. They are versatile and can store elements of different data types. Code Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Access element by index
fruits.append("orange")  # Add element to the list
print(len(fruits))  # Get length of the list
```

Slide 8: Conditionals

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. Code Example:

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

Slide 9: Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports two types of loops: for and while. Code Example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Hello")
    count += 1
```

Slide 10: Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize and modularize your code. Code Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

Slide 11: Modules

Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs. Code Example:

```python
import math

radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print("Area of the circle:", area)
```
