## Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds

Differential analysis on complex manifolds is a branch of mathematics that combines complex analysis, differential geometry, and topology. It studies the properties of complex-valued functions on complex manifolds, which are spaces that locally resemble complex Euclidean space. This field has applications in theoretical physics, particularly in string theory and quantum field theory.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_complex_function(f, x_range, y_range, resolution=100):
    x = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], resolution)
    y = np.linspace(y_range[0], y_range[1], resolution)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = X + 1j*Y
    W = f(Z)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
    plt.subplot(121)
    plt.contourf(X, Y, np.abs(W), levels=20)
    plt.colorbar(label='Magnitude')
    plt.title('Magnitude')
    
    plt.subplot(122)
    plt.contourf(X, Y, np.angle(W), levels=20)
    plt.colorbar(label='Phase')
    plt.title('Phase')
    
    plt.suptitle(f'Complex function: {f.__name__}')
    plt.show()

def example_function(z):
    return z**2 + 1

plot_complex_function(example_function, (-2, 2), (-2, 2))
```

Slide 2: Complex Manifolds: Definition and Examples

A complex manifold is a topological space that locally resembles complex Euclidean space and has a globally defined complex structure. One of the simplest examples is the complex plane itself. More interesting examples include Riemann surfaces, complex projective spaces, and complex tori.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

def plot_riemann_sphere():
    u = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
    v = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100)
    x = np.outer(np.cos(u), np.sin(v))
    y = np.outer(np.sin(u), np.sin(v))
    z = np.outer(np.ones(np.size(u)), np.cos(v))
    
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.plot_surface(x, y, z, rstride=4, cstride=4, color='b', alpha=0.7)
    
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y')
    ax.set_zlabel('Z')
    ax.set_title('Riemann Sphere')
    plt.show()

plot_riemann_sphere()
```

Slide 3: Holomorphic Functions on Complex Manifolds

Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis. On complex manifolds, these functions are defined locally and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. They possess many interesting properties, such as analyticity and the ability to be represented as power series.

```python
import sympy as sp

def check_holomorphic(f, z):
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    z = x + sp.I*y
    f_expr = f(z)
    
    u = sp.re(f_expr)
    v = sp.im(f_expr)
    
    du_dx = sp.diff(u, x)
    du_dy = sp.diff(u, y)
    dv_dx = sp.diff(v, x)
    dv_dy = sp.diff(v, y)
    
    cr_equations = (du_dx == dv_dy) and (du_dy == -dv_dx)
    
    return cr_equations

# Example: Check if f(z) = z^2 is holomorphic
z = sp.Symbol('z')
f = lambda z: z**2

result = check_holomorphic(f, z)
print(f"Is f(z) = z^2 holomorphic? {result}")
```

Slide 4: Differential Forms on Complex Manifolds

Differential forms are fundamental objects in differential geometry and play a crucial role in the study of complex manifolds. They provide a coordinate-independent way to express integrands and are essential for defining integration on manifolds.

```python
import sympy as sp

def wedge_product(form1, form2):
    return sp.Matrix([form1.cross(form2)])

# Define symbols and 1-forms
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')
dx = sp.Matrix([1, 0, 0])
dy = sp.Matrix([0, 1, 0])
dz = sp.Matrix([0, 0, 1])

# Compute the wedge product of dx and dy
omega = wedge_product(dx, dy)

print("Wedge product of dx and dy:")
print(omega)
```

Slide 5: Complex Differential Operators

Complex differential operators, such as the Dolbeault operators ∂ and ∂̄, are essential tools in the study of complex manifolds. These operators generalize the concept of differentiation to complex-valued functions on complex manifolds.

```python
import sympy as sp

def dolbeault_operators(f, z):
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    z = x + sp.I*y
    f_expr = f(z)
    
    del_f = sp.diff(f_expr, x) - sp.I * sp.diff(f_expr, y)
    del_bar_f = sp.diff(f_expr, x) + sp.I * sp.diff(f_expr, y)
    
    return del_f / 2, del_bar_f / 2

# Example: Apply Dolbeault operators to f(z) = z^2
z = sp.Symbol('z')
f = lambda z: z**2

del_f, del_bar_f = dolbeault_operators(f, z)
print(f"∂f/∂z = {del_f}")
print(f"∂f/∂z̄ = {del_bar_f}")
```

Slide 6: Kähler Manifolds

Kähler manifolds are a special class of complex manifolds that possess a compatible Riemannian metric and symplectic form. They play a crucial role in algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. Examples include complex projective spaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_complex_projective_line():
    theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
    x = np.cos(theta)
    y = np.sin(theta)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.fill(x, y, alpha=0.2)
    plt.title("Complex Projective Line (CP¹)")
    plt.xlabel("Re(z)")
    plt.ylabel("Im(z)")
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_complex_projective_line()
```

Slide 7: Hodge Theory on Complex Manifolds

Hodge theory is a powerful tool in the study of complex manifolds, providing a deep connection between the topology and complex structure of these spaces. It generalizes de Rham cohomology to complex-valued differential forms and introduces the concept of Hodge decomposition.

```python
import sympy as sp

def hodge_star_operator(form, dim):
    if dim == 2:
        x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
        dx = sp.Matrix([1, 0])
        dy = sp.Matrix([0, 1])
        
        if form == dx:
            return dy
        elif form == dy:
            return -dx
        else:
            return sp.Matrix([0, 0])
    else:
        raise ValueError("This example only supports 2D forms")

# Example: Apply Hodge star operator to dx and dy in 2D
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
dx = sp.Matrix([1, 0])
dy = sp.Matrix([0, 1])

star_dx = hodge_star_operator(dx, 2)
star_dy = hodge_star_operator(dy, 2)

print(f"*(dx) = {star_dx}")
print(f"*(dy) = {star_dy}")
```

Slide 8: Sheaf Theory and Cohomology

Sheaf theory provides a powerful framework for studying local-to-global properties on complex manifolds. Sheaf cohomology generalizes the notion of cohomology to sheaves of abelian groups and is essential in complex geometry and algebraic geometry.

```python
class Sheaf:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.sections = {}
    
    def add_section(self, open_set, section):
        self.sections[open_set] = section
    
    def get_section(self, open_set):
        return self.sections.get(open_set, None)
    
    def restrict(self, open_set, subset):
        if open_set in self.sections and subset.issubset(open_set):
            return self.sections[open_set]
        return None

# Example usage
U = {1, 2, 3, 4}
V = {3, 4, 5}
W = {3, 4}

O = Sheaf("Structure sheaf")
O.add_section(U, "f_U")
O.add_section(V, "f_V")

print(f"Section over U: {O.get_section(U)}")
print(f"Section over V: {O.get_section(V)}")
print(f"Restriction of U to W: {O.restrict(U, W)}")
```

Slide 9: Chern Classes and Characteristic Classes

Chern classes are topological invariants associated with complex vector bundles over complex manifolds. They provide important information about the topology and geometry of the underlying manifold and have applications in various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.

```python
import sympy as sp

def chern_class(c1, c2):
    return 1 + c1 + c2

# Example: Compute Chern class for a rank 2 vector bundle
c1, c2 = sp.symbols('c1 c2')
total_chern_class = chern_class(c1, c2)

print(f"Total Chern class: c(E) = {total_chern_class}")
print(f"First Chern class: c1(E) = {c1}")
print(f"Second Chern class: c2(E) = {c2}")
```

Slide 10: Harmonic Forms and Hodge Decomposition

Harmonic forms play a crucial role in the study of complex manifolds. The Hodge decomposition theorem states that on a compact Kähler manifold, every differential form can be uniquely decomposed into the sum of a harmonic form, an exact form, and a co-exact form.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import eigh

def laplacian_2d(n):
    L = np.zeros((n**2, n**2))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            idx = i * n + j
            L[idx, idx] = 4
            if i > 0:
                L[idx, idx - n] = -1
            if i < n - 1:
                L[idx, idx + n] = -1
            if j > 0:
                L[idx, idx - 1] = -1
            if j < n - 1:
                L[idx, idx + 1] = -1
    return L

def find_harmonic_forms(n, k):
    L = laplacian_2d(n)
    eigvals, eigvecs = eigh(L)
    harmonic_forms = eigvecs[:, :k]
    return harmonic_forms

# Example: Find the first 3 harmonic forms on a 5x5 grid
n = 5
k = 3
harmonic_forms = find_harmonic_forms(n, k)

for i in range(k):
    print(f"Harmonic form {i + 1}:")
    print(harmonic_forms[:, i].reshape(n, n))
    print()
```

Slide 11: Dolbeault Cohomology

Dolbeault cohomology is a refinement of de Rham cohomology for complex manifolds. It provides a finer decomposition of the cohomology groups and is closely related to the holomorphic structure of the manifold. The Dolbeault complex is fundamental in studying holomorphic vector bundles and sheaf cohomology.

```python
import sympy as sp

def dolbeault_complex(f, z, n):
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    z = x + sp.I*y
    f_expr = f(z)
    
    dolbeault_operators = []
    current_form = f_expr
    
    for i in range(n):
        del_bar_f = sp.diff(current_form, x) + sp.I * sp.diff(current_form, y)
        dolbeault_operators.append(del_bar_f / 2)
        current_form = del_bar_f / 2
    
    return dolbeault_operators

# Example: Compute Dolbeault complex for f(z) = z^3 up to order 3
z = sp.Symbol('z')
f = lambda z: z**3
n = 3

dolbeault_ops = dolbeault_complex(f, z, n)

for i, op in enumerate(dolbeault_ops):
    print(f"∂̄^({i+1})f = {op}")
```

Slide 12: Holomorphic Vector Bundles

Holomorphic vector bundles are fundamental objects in complex geometry, generalizing the notion of vector spaces to complex manifolds. They play a crucial role in the study of gauge theories in physics and are closely related to algebraic geometry through the Serre-Swan theorem.

```python
class HolomorphicVectorBundle:
    def __init__(self, base_manifold, rank, transition_functions):
        self.base_manifold = base_manifold
        self.rank = rank
        self.transition_functions = transition_functions
    
    def local_trivialization(self, point, chart):
        # Simplified representation of local trivialization
        return f"Fiber at {point} in chart {chart}"
    
    def transition(self, point, chart1, chart2):
        key = (chart1, chart2)
        if key in self.transition_functions:
            return self.transition_functions[key](point)
        return None

# Example usage
base_manifold = "Complex projective line CP¹"
rank = 2
transition_functions = {
    ("U", "V"): lambda z: [[z, 0], [0, 1/z]]  # Transition function for O(1) ⊕ O(-1)
}

bundle = HolomorphicVectorBundle(base_manifold, rank, transition_functions)

print(f"Vector bundle over {bundle.base_manifold} of rank {bundle.rank}")
print(f"Local trivialization: {bundle.local_trivialization('p', 'U')}")
print(f"Transition function (U to V): {bundle.transition(1, 'U', 'V')}")
```

Slide 13: Applications in Physics: Calabi-Yau Manifolds

Calabi-Yau manifolds are complex Kähler manifolds with a vanishing first Chern class. They play a crucial role in string theory, where they are used as compactification spaces. The study of these manifolds involves sophisticated techniques from algebraic geometry and differential geometry.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

def plot_quintic_threefold():
    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    
    Z = X**5 + Y**5 - 1
    
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis')
    
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y')
    ax.set_zlabel('Z')
    ax.set_title('Slice of Quintic Threefold')
    plt.show()

plot_quintic_threefold()
```

Slide 14: Deformation Theory of Complex Structures

Deformation theory studies how complex structures on a manifold can be continuously varied. This is crucial for understanding moduli spaces of complex structures and has applications in mirror symmetry and algebraic geometry.

```python
import sympy as sp

def compute_kodaira_spencer_map(X, v):
    t = sp.Symbol('t')
    deformed_structure = X + t * v
    
    # Compute Lie derivative
    lie_derivative = sp.diff(deformed_structure, t).subs(t, 0)
    
    return lie_derivative

# Example: Compute Kodaira-Spencer map for a simple deformation
X = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])  # Initial complex structure
v = sp.Matrix([[0, 1], [-1, 0]])  # Deformation vector

result = compute_kodaira_spencer_map(X, v)
print("Kodaira-Spencer map result:")
print(result)
```
