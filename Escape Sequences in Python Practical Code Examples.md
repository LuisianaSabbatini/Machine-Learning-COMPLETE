## Escape Sequences in Python Practical Code Examples
Slide 1: Introduction to Escape Sequences

Escape sequences in Python are special character combinations beginning with a backslash that represent unique characters or actions within strings. They enable programmers to include characters that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to represent directly in code.

```python
# Basic escape sequences demonstration
print("Line 1\nLine 2")  # Newline
print("Tab\tindented")   # Tab
print("\"Quoted text\"") # Quotes
print('It\'s a string')  # Single quote
print("Backslash: \\")   # Backslash

# Output:
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Tab     indented
# "Quoted text"
# It's a string
# Backslash: \
```

Slide 2: Common Escape Sequences

Python provides several essential escape sequences for string manipulation and formatting. These sequences handle special characters like newlines, tabs, and backspaces, enabling precise control over text presentation and formatting.

```python
# Demonstrating common escape sequences
text = "Path: C:\\Users\\Admin\nAlert:\a\rCarriage Return"
print(text)
print("Form Feed:\f Next Page")
print("Vertical Tab:\v Next Line")
print("Backspace: Back\bspace")

# Output:
# Path: C:\Users\Admin
# Alert:[BELL SOUND]
# Carriage Return
# Form Feed: Next Page
# Vertical Tab: Next Line
# Backspace: Backspace
```

Slide 3: Unicode Escape Sequences

Python supports Unicode escape sequences allowing representation of any Unicode character using \\u followed by four hexadecimal digits or \\U followed by eight hexadecimal digits. This enables international character support in strings.

```python
# Unicode escape sequence examples
print("\u0394")          # Greek Delta
print("\u03A9")          # Greek Omega
print("\U0001F600")      # Emoji (Grinning Face)
print("\N{EURO SIGN}")   # Named Unicode character

# Binary, octal and hex escapes
print("\x41")            # Hex for 'A'
print("\141")            # Octal for 'a'

# Output:
# Œî
# Œ©
# üòÄ
# ‚Ç¨
# A
# a
```

Slide 4: Raw Strings and Escape Sequences

Raw strings, prefixed with 'r' or 'R', treat backslashes as literal characters, preventing escape sequence interpretation. This feature is particularly useful when working with regular expressions or file paths in Windows systems.

```python
# Regular string vs raw string comparison
regular_string = "C:\new\text.txt"
raw_string = r"C:\new\text.txt"

print("Regular string:", regular_string)
print("Raw string:", raw_string)

# File path handling
import os
windows_path = r"C:\Users\Documents\file.txt"
cross_platform_path = os.path.join("C:", "Users", "Documents", "file.txt")

# Output:
# Regular string: C:
# ew	ext.txt
# Raw string: C:\new\text.txt
```

Slide 5: Escape Sequences in Regular Expressions

Escape sequences play a crucial role in regular expressions, where they define pattern matching rules. Python's re module requires careful handling of escape sequences, especially when dealing with special regex characters.

```python
import re

# Regular expression with escape sequences
text = "Phone: 123-456-7890\nEmail: user@example.com"
phone_pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}"
email_pattern = r"\w+@\w+\.\w+"

phone = re.search(phone_pattern, text)
email = re.search(email_pattern, text)

print("Phone:", phone.group())
print("Email:", email.group())

# Output:
# Phone: 123-456-7890
# Email: user@example.com
```

Slide 6: Escape Sequences in String Formatting

Escape sequences interact with string formatting methods in Python, requiring careful consideration when combining them with format specifiers. Understanding their behavior is crucial for complex string manipulation tasks.

```python
# String formatting with escape sequences
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted = "Name:\t%s\nAge:\t%d" % (name, age)
f_string = f"Name:\t{name}\nAge:\t{age}"
template = "Name:\t{}\nAge:\t{}".format(name, age)

print(formatted)
print("\n" + "="*20 + "\n")
print(f_string)
print("\n" + "="*20 + "\n")
print(template)

# Output:
# Name:   Alice
# Age:    30
# ====================
# Name:   Alice
# Age:    30
# ====================
# Name:   Alice
# Age:    30
```

Slide 7: Handling Special Characters in File Operations

File operations often require careful handling of escape sequences, especially when reading from or writing to files with special characters. Understanding proper escape sequence usage prevents common file handling errors.

```python
# Writing and reading with escape sequences
content = "Line 1\tTabbed\nLine 2\tTabbed\n"

# Writing to file
with open("example.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(content)

# Reading with different methods
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    # Read as is
    raw = f.read()
    f.seek(0)
    # Read and interpret literally
    literal = repr(f.read())

print("Raw content:")
print(raw)
print("\nLiteral content:")
print(literal)

# Output:
# Raw content:
# Line 1  Tabbed
# Line 2  Tabbed
#
# Literal content:
# 'Line 1\tTabbed\nLine 2\tTabbed\n'
```

Slide 8: Escape Sequences in Binary Data

Binary data handling often requires escape sequences for proper interpretation and manipulation. Understanding how escape sequences work with binary data is essential for network programming and file processing.

```python
# Binary data with escape sequences
binary_string = b"Hello\x00World\xff"
escaped_string = "Hello\x00World\xff"

print("Binary representation:")
print(binary_string)
print("\nHex representation:")
print(binary_string.hex())
print("\nEscaped string:")
print(repr(escaped_string))

# Working with bytes
encoded = "Hello üåç".encode('utf-8')
print("\nUTF-8 bytes:")
print(list(encoded))

# Output:
# Binary representation:
# b'Hello\x00World\xff'
# Hex representation:
# 48656c6c6f00576f726c64ff
# Escaped string:
# 'Hello\x00World\xff'
# UTF-8 bytes:
# [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 240, 159, 140, 141]
```

Slide 9: Error Handling with Escape Sequences

When processing strings with escape sequences, various errors can occur due to invalid escape sequence syntax or encoding issues. Implementing proper error handling ensures robust string processing in production environments.

```python
# Error handling for escape sequences
def process_string(input_str):
    try:
        # Try to process string with escape sequences
        processed = bytes(input_str, "utf-8").decode("unicode-escape")
        return processed
    except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
        return f"Invalid escape sequence: {e}"
    except ValueError as e:
        return f"Value error: {e}"

# Test cases
test_strings = [
    "Valid: \u0394",
    "Invalid: \u12ZZ",
    "Mixed: \u0394\u12ZZ",
]

for test in test_strings:
    result = process_string(test)
    print(f"Input: {test}")
    print(f"Result: {result}\n")

# Output:
# Input: Valid: \u0394
# Result: Valid: Œî
#
# Input: Invalid: \u12ZZ
# Result: Invalid escape sequence: ...
#
# Input: Mixed: \u0394\u12ZZ
# Result: Invalid escape sequence: ...
```

Slide 10: Memory-Efficient String Processing

Complex string processing with escape sequences can impact memory usage. Understanding memory-efficient techniques for handling large strings with escape sequences is crucial for optimizing Python applications.

```python
# Memory-efficient string processing
def process_large_string(input_string, chunk_size=1024):
    from io import StringIO
    output = StringIO()
    
    # Process string in chunks
    for i in range(0, len(input_string), chunk_size):
        chunk = input_string[i:i + chunk_size]
        # Handle escape sequences that might be split
        if chunk.endswith('\\'):
            chunk = chunk[:-1]
            next_char = input_string[i + chunk_size:i + chunk_size + 1]
            if next_char:
                chunk += '\\' + next_char
        
        # Process chunk
        processed = chunk.encode('utf-8').decode('unicode-escape')
        output.write(processed)
    
    return output.getvalue()

# Example usage
large_string = "Hello\\u0394" * 1000
result = process_large_string(large_string, chunk_size=10)
print(f"First 50 characters: {result[:50]}")
print(f"Total length: {len(result)}")

# Output:
# First 50 characters: HelloŒîHelloŒîHelloŒîHelloŒîHelloŒîHelloŒîHelloŒîHello
# Total length: 5000
```

Slide 11: Custom Escape Sequence Handler

Implementing a custom escape sequence handler allows for specialized string processing needs. This example demonstrates how to create a flexible system for handling both standard and custom escape sequences.

```python
class CustomEscapeHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.custom_escapes = {
            '\\custom': '[CUSTOM]',
            '\\mark': 'Ô∏è‚úì',
            '\\star': '‚≠ê'
        }
    
    def add_escape(self, sequence, replacement):
        self.custom_escapes[f'\\{sequence}'] = replacement
    
    def process(self, text):
        result = text
        # Handle custom escapes
        for escape, replacement in self.custom_escapes.items():
            result = result.replace(escape, replacement)
        # Handle standard escapes
        return result.encode().decode('unicode-escape')

# Usage example
handler = CustomEscapeHandler()
handler.add_escape('check', '‚úîÔ∏è')
handler.add_escape('warn', '‚ö†Ô∏è')

test_text = r"Status: \check\nWarning: \warn\nRating: \star"
result = handler.process(test_text)
print(result)

# Output:
# Status: ‚úîÔ∏è
# Warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è
# Rating: ‚≠ê
```

Slide 12: Real-world Application: Log Parser

This implementation demonstrates a practical application of escape sequence handling in log file processing, commonly used in system administration and debugging tasks.

```python
class LogParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.escape_patterns = {
            r'\n': '\n',  # Newline
            r'\t': '\t',  # Tab
            r'\r': '\r',  # Carriage return
            r'\x1b\[\d+m': ''  # ANSI color codes
        }
    
    def parse_log_line(self, line):
        import re
        # Remove ANSI escape sequences
        for pattern, replacement in self.escape_patterns.items():
            line = re.sub(pattern, replacement, line)
        return line.strip()
    
    def process_log_file(self, content):
        processed_lines = []
        for line in content.split('\n'):
            processed = self.parse_log_line(line)
            if processed:
                processed_lines.append(processed)
        return processed_lines

# Example usage
log_content = """
\x1b[32mINFO\x1b[0m: System start\tStatus: OK
\x1b[31mERROR\x1b[0m: Connection failed\r\n\tRetrying...
\x1b[33mWARN\x1b[0m: Timeout occurred
"""

parser = LogParser()
results = parser.process_log_file(log_content)
for line in results:
    print(line)

# Output:
# INFO: System start    Status: OK
# ERROR: Connection failed    Retrying...
# WARN: Timeout occurred
```
