## Homological Algebra in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Homological Algebra

Homological Algebra is a branch of abstract algebra that studies algebraic structures and their properties using techniques from homology theory. It provides a unified framework for understanding various algebraic concepts and has applications in different areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and representation theory.

Slide 2: Modules and Chain Complexes

In Homological Algebra, we work with modules over rings, which are generalizations of vector spaces. A chain complex is a sequence of modules connected by homomorphisms, with the property that the composition of any two consecutive homomorphisms is zero.

Code Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a ring
R = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=int)

# Define a module over R
M = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=int)

# Define a chain complex
C = [M, M, M]
d1 = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=int)
d2 = np.array([[1, 1], [0, 0]], dtype=int)
d = [d1, d2]
```

Slide 3: Homology and Cohomology

Homology and cohomology are fundamental concepts in Homological Algebra. Homology groups measure the "holes" or cycles in a chain complex, while cohomology groups measure the "obstructions" or co-cycles.

Code Example:

```python
from scipy.linalg import null_space, matrix_rank

def homology(C, d):
    H = []
    for i in range(len(C) - 1):
        Z = null_space(d[i])
        B = d[i + 1].dot(C[i + 1]).T
        H.append(matrix_rank(Z) - matrix_rank(B))
    return H

# Compute homology groups
H = homology(C, d)
print("Homology groups:", H)
```

Slide 4: Exact Sequences

An exact sequence in Homological Algebra is a chain complex where the image of one homomorphism is equal to the kernel of the next homomorphism. Exact sequences play a crucial role in studying algebraic structures and their relationships.

Code Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define an exact sequence
R = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=int)
M = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=int)
N = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]], dtype=int)

f = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=int)
g = np.array([[1, 1], [0, 0]], dtype=int)

def is_exact(f, g, M, N):
    im_f = f.dot(M).T
    ker_g = null_space(g)
    return np.array_equal(im_f, ker_g.T)

print("Is the sequence exact?", is_exact(f, g, M, N))
```

Slide 5: Derived Functors

Derived functors, such as Ext and Tor, are powerful tools in Homological Algebra that arise from the failure of certain functors to be exact. They provide a way to measure and study the "defects" of these functors, leading to a deeper understanding of algebraic structures.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define rings and modules
R = sym.PolynomialRing(sym.QQ, 'x')
M = R.free_module(2)
N = R.free_module(2)

# Define a non-exact sequence
f = R.matrix([[x, 0], [0, x]])
g = R.matrix([[x, 0], [0, 0]])

# Compute Ext and Tor
Ext = sym.Ext(M, N, f, g)
Tor = sym.Tor(M, N, f, g)

print("Ext:", Ext)
print("Tor:", Tor)
```

Slide 6: Category Theory and Functors

Category Theory provides a unifying language for Homological Algebra. Functors are structure-preserving maps between categories, and their properties, such as exactness and adjointness, are crucial in understanding algebraic structures and their relationships.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define categories
Ab = sym.Category("Ab")  # Category of Abelian groups
Mod = sym.Category("Mod")  # Category of modules over a ring

# Define a functor
def F(M, N, f):
    return sym.tensor_product(M, N), sym.tensor_functor(f)

# Check if the functor is exact
tensor_functor = F.__func__
is_exact = tensor_functor.is_exact()
print("Is the tensor functor exact?", is_exact)
```

Slide 7: Projective and Injective Modules

Projective and injective modules play a central role in Homological Algebra. Projective modules are analogous to free modules, while injective modules are analogous to divisible modules. These concepts are essential for understanding derived functors and resolving certain algebraic problems.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define a ring and modules
R = sym.QQ
M = R.free_module(2)
N = R.free_module(2)

# Check if M is projective
is_projective = M.is_projective()
print("Is M projective?", is_projective)

# Check if N is injective
is_injective = N.is_injective()
print("Is N injective?", is_injective)
```

Slide 8: Resolutions and Derived Functors

Resolutions are fundamental tools in Homological Algebra that allow us to replace modules with "nicer" modules, such as projective or injective modules. These resolutions are used to compute derived functors and study algebraic structures more effectively.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define a ring and module
R = sym.QQ
M = R.free_module(2)

# Compute a projective resolution
proj_res = M.projective_resolution()
print("Projective resolution:", proj_res)

# Compute an injective resolution
inj_res = M.injective_resolution()
print("Injective resolution:", inj_res)
```

lide 9: Spectral Sequences

Spectral sequences are powerful computational tools in Homological Algebra that allow us to organize and visualize the calculation of derived functors. They provide a way to systematically compute homology and cohomology groups, as well as other algebraic invariants. A spectral sequence is a sequence of algebraic objects (typically modules or chain complexes) connected by homomorphisms, where each object is filtered, and the filtration induces a series of algebraic structures called pages. The spectral sequence starts with the initial page and converges to a final page, which represents the desired algebraic invariant.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define a chain complex
R = sym.QQ
C = [R**3, R**2, R]
d1 = sym.Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
d2 = sym.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])

# Compute the spectral sequence
spectral_seq = sym.SpectralSequence(C, d1, d2)
print("Spectral sequence:", spectral_seq)

# Compute the initial page
E0 = spectral_seq.initial_page()
print("Initial page (E^0):", E0)

# Compute the first page
E1 = spectral_seq.next_page(E0)
print("First page (E^1):", E1)

# Compute the second page
E2 = spectral_seq.next_page(E1)
print("Second page (E^2):", E2)

# Compute the final page (homology groups)
H = spectral_seq.final_page()
print("Final page (Homology groups):", H)
```

In this example, we define a chain complex `C` with the differential maps `d1` and `d2`. We create a `SpectralSequence` object using these components and compute the initial page (`E^0`), first page (`E^1`), second page (`E^2`), and the final page, which represents the homology groups of the chain complex.

The spectral sequence provides a systematic way to compute homology and cohomology groups, as well as other derived functors, by organizing the calculations into a series of algebraic structures called pages. This powerful tool is widely used in various areas of Homological Algebra and its applications.

Slide 10: Sheaf Cohomology

Sheaf Cohomology is a powerful application of Homological Algebra in algebraic geometry. It provides a way to study the cohomology of sheaves on topological spaces, leading to a deeper understanding of geometric objects and their properties.

A sheaf is a mathematical object that assigns a collection of algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, or modules) to the open sets of a topological space, satisfying certain compatibility conditions. Sheaf Cohomology is the study of the cohomology groups of these sheaves, which capture important geometric and topological information about the underlying space and the sheaf itself.

Sheaf Cohomology has applications in various areas of algebraic geometry, including the study of vector bundles, coherent sheaves, and the resolution of singularities. It also plays a crucial role in the formulation of the Riemann-Roch theorem and the development of intersection theory.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define a topological space and a sheaf
X = sym.RealLine()
F = sym.SheafCohomologyRing(X, sym.QQ)

# Compute sheaf cohomology groups
H0 = F.cohomology(0)
H1 = F.cohomology(1)
H2 = F.cohomology(2)

print("H^0(X, F):", H0)
print("H^1(X, F):", H1)
print("H^2(X, F):", H2)

# Compute the Čech cohomology groups
cover = [sym.Interval(0, 1), sym.Interval(1, 2)]
C = sym.CechComplex(F, cover)
H_Cech = C.cohomology()

print("Čech cohomology groups:", H_Cech)
```

In this example, we define a topological space `X` (the real line) and a sheaf `F` (the constant sheaf with values in the rational numbers). We compute the sheaf cohomology groups `H^0(X, F)`, `H^1(X, F)`, and `H^2(X, F)` using the `cohomology` method of the `SheafCohomologyRing` object.

Additionally, we compute the Čech cohomology groups, which provide an alternative way to compute sheaf cohomology using a specific open cover of the topological space. We define a cover `cover` consisting of two open intervals, create a `CechComplex` object `C`, and compute its cohomology groups using the `cohomology` method.

Sheaf Cohomology is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry, allowing us to study the properties of geometric objects through the lens of cohomology theory and providing deep insights into their structure and behavior.

Slide 11: Tor and Ext Functors

The Tor and Ext functors are two of the most important derived functors in Homological Algebra. Tor measures the "defect" of the tensor product functor, while Ext measures the "defect" of the Hom functor. These functors are crucial for understanding algebraic structures and their relationships.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define rings and modules
R = sym.QQ
M = R.free_module(2)
N = R.free_module(2)

# Compute Tor and Ext
Tor = sym.Tor(M, N)
Ext = sym.Ext(M, N)

print("Tor:", Tor)
print("Ext:", Ext)
```

Slide 12: Hochschild and Cyclic Homology

Hochschild and Cyclic Homology are important theories in Homological Algebra that provide a way to study algebraic structures, such as algebras and their representations. They have applications in various areas, including algebraic geometry, noncommutative geometry, and mathematical physics.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define an algebra
A = sym.QQ.algebraic_field(sym.sqrt(2))
A_alg = sym.NonCommutativeSymbolicAlgebra(A, 'x', 'y')

# Compute Hochschild homology
HH = sym.HochschildHomology(A_alg)
print("Hochschild homology:", HH)

# Compute Cyclic homology
HC = sym.CyclicHomology(A_alg)
print("Cyclic homology:", HC)
```

Slide 13: Algebraic K-Theory

Algebraic K-Theory is a branch of Homological Algebra that studies algebraic structures by associating certain abelian groups or rings to them. These K-groups provide a way to measure and understand algebraic invariants, with applications in various areas, including algebraic geometry, topology, and number theory.

Code Example:

```python
import sympy as sym

# Define a ring
R = sym.QQ[x, y]

# Compute algebraic K-groups
K0 = sym.K0(R)
K1 = sym.K1(R)

print("K0 group:", K0)
print("K1 group:", K1)
```
