## Quantifying Complexity in the Coffee Automaton
Slide 1: The Coffee Automaton: Exploring Complexity in Closed Systems

The Coffee Automaton is a conceptual model used to study the emergence and decay of complexity in closed systems. This model draws inspiration from the process of brewing and consuming coffee, serving as an analogy for more complex systems in nature and society.

```python
import random

class CoffeeAutomaton:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.grid = [[random.choice(['C', 'W', ' ']) for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
        self.size = size

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print(' '.join(row))
        print()

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
coffee.display()
```

Slide 2: Understanding Closed Systems

A closed system is one that does not exchange matter with its surroundings but may exchange energy. In our Coffee Automaton, the coffee cup represents a closed system where complexity arises and eventually dissipates.

```python
def is_closed_system(system):
    initial_matter = sum(cell != ' ' for row in system.grid for cell in row)
    
    # Simulate some steps
    for _ in range(10):
        system.step()
    
    final_matter = sum(cell != ' ' for row in system.grid for cell in row)
    
    return initial_matter == final_matter

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
print(f"Is closed system: {is_closed_system(coffee)}")
```

Slide 3: Defining Complexity in the Coffee Automaton

In our model, complexity is defined by the interactions between coffee particles ('C') and water molecules ('W'). The more diverse and structured these interactions, the higher the complexity.

```python
def calculate_complexity(grid):
    complexity = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid)):
            if grid[i][j] == 'C':
                for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid) and grid[ni][nj] == 'W':
                        complexity += 1
    return complexity

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
print(f"Initial complexity: {calculate_complexity(coffee.grid)}")
```

Slide 4: The Rise of Complexity: Brewing Process

As we "brew" our coffee, complexity increases. This is analogous to the initial stages of many systems where components begin to interact and form more intricate structures.

```python
def brew(self):
    for i in range(self.size):
        for j in range(self.size):
            if self.grid[i][j] == ' ':
                if random.random() < 0.1:
                    self.grid[i][j] = random.choice(['C', 'W'])

CoffeeAutomaton.brew = brew

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
print("Before brewing:")
coffee.display()
coffee.brew()
print("After brewing:")
coffee.display()
print(f"Complexity after brewing: {calculate_complexity(coffee.grid)}")
```

Slide 5: Peak Complexity: The Perfect Cup

At some point, our coffee reaches peak complexity. This represents a state of maximum interaction and structure within the system.

```python
def find_peak_complexity(size, max_steps):
    coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(size)
    peak_complexity = 0
    peak_step = 0
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        coffee.brew()
        current_complexity = calculate_complexity(coffee.grid)
        if current_complexity > peak_complexity:
            peak_complexity = current_complexity
            peak_step = step
    
    return peak_complexity, peak_step

peak, step = find_peak_complexity(10, 100)
print(f"Peak complexity {peak} reached at step {step}")
```

Slide 6: The Fall of Complexity: Entropy Takes Over

As time passes, the system tends towards equilibrium. In our coffee model, this is represented by the mixing and cooling of the coffee, leading to a decrease in complexity.

```python
def cool_and_mix(self):
    for i in range(self.size):
        for j in range(self.size):
            if random.random() < 0.05:
                if self.grid[i][j] in ['C', 'W']:
                    self.grid[i][j] = ' '
            elif random.random() < 0.1:
                ni, nj = (i + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size, (j + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size
                self.grid[i][j], self.grid[ni][nj] = self.grid[ni][nj], self.grid[i][j]

CoffeeAutomaton.cool_and_mix = cool_and_mix

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
coffee.brew()
print("After brewing:")
coffee.display()
for _ in range(5):
    coffee.cool_and_mix()
print("After cooling and mixing:")
coffee.display()
```

Slide 7: Quantifying the Complexity Curve

To understand the rise and fall of complexity, we can plot the complexity over time. This gives us a visual representation of how the system evolves.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_complexity_curve(size, steps):
    coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(size)
    complexities = []
    
    for _ in range(steps):
        coffee.brew()
        coffee.cool_and_mix()
        complexities.append(calculate_complexity(coffee.grid))
    
    plt.plot(range(steps), complexities)
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Complexity')
    plt.title('Complexity over Time in Coffee Automaton')
    plt.show()

plot_complexity_curve(10, 100)
```

Slide 8: Emergent Patterns: Identifying Structure

As our coffee system evolves, we may observe emergent patterns or structures. These can be quantified and analyzed to better understand the system's behavior.

```python
def identify_patterns(grid):
    patterns = {
        'clusters': 0,
        'alternating': 0,
        'empty_regions': 0
    }
    
    for i in range(len(grid) - 1):
        for j in range(len(grid[i]) - 1):
            if grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j] == grid[i][j+1] == grid[i+1][j+1] != ' ':
                patterns['clusters'] += 1
            if grid[i][j] != grid[i+1][j] and grid[i][j] != grid[i][j+1] and grid[i][j] != ' ':
                patterns['alternating'] += 1
            if grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j] == grid[i][j+1] == grid[i+1][j+1] == ' ':
                patterns['empty_regions'] += 1
    
    return patterns

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
coffee.brew()
print("Identified patterns:", identify_patterns(coffee.grid))
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Ecosystem Dynamics

The Coffee Automaton can be seen as an analogy for ecosystem dynamics. Just as our coffee system has periods of increasing complexity (species interactions) followed by simplification (loss of biodiversity), so too do real ecosystems experience similar patterns.

```python
class Ecosystem(CoffeeAutomaton):
    def __init__(self, size):
        super().__init__(size)
        self.species = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0}
    
    def populate(self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            for j in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[i][j] == ' ':
                    if random.random() < 0.1:
                        species = random.choice(list(self.species.keys()))
                        self.grid[i][j] = species
                        self.species[species] += 1
    
    def interact(self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            for j in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[i][j] != ' ':
                    if random.random() < 0.05:  # Death
                        self.species[self.grid[i][j]] -= 1
                        self.grid[i][j] = ' '
                    elif random.random() < 0.1:  # Reproduction
                        ni, nj = (i + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size, (j + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size
                        if self.grid[ni][nj] == ' ':
                            self.grid[ni][nj] = self.grid[i][j]
                            self.species[self.grid[i][j]] += 1

ecosystem = Ecosystem(10)
for _ in range(10):
    ecosystem.populate()
    ecosystem.interact()
print("Species count:", ecosystem.species)
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Urban Development

Another real-life application of the Coffee Automaton concept can be seen in urban development. Cities grow in complexity as they develop, but may eventually face challenges that lead to simplification or decay in certain areas.

```python
class UrbanArea(CoffeeAutomaton):
    def __init__(self, size):
        super().__init__(size)
        self.structures = {'R': 0, 'C': 0, 'I': 0}  # Residential, Commercial, Industrial
    
    def develop(self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            for j in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[i][j] == ' ':
                    if random.random() < 0.1:
                        structure = random.choice(list(self.structures.keys()))
                        self.grid[i][j] = structure
                        self.structures[structure] += 1
    
    def urban_dynamics(self):
        for i in range(self.size):
            for j in range(self.size):
                if self.grid[i][j] != ' ':
                    if random.random() < 0.05:  # Decay
                        self.structures[self.grid[i][j]] -= 1
                        self.grid[i][j] = ' '
                    elif random.random() < 0.1:  # Expansion
                        ni, nj = (i + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size, (j + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % self.size
                        if self.grid[ni][nj] == ' ':
                            self.grid[ni][nj] = self.grid[i][j]
                            self.structures[self.grid[i][j]] += 1

city = UrbanArea(10)
for _ in range(10):
    city.develop()
    city.urban_dynamics()
print("Urban structures:", city.structures)
```

Slide 11: Measuring Information Content

We can use information theory to quantify the complexity in our system. One way to do this is by calculating the entropy, which measures the unpredictability or randomness in the system.

```python
import math

def calculate_entropy(grid):
    flat_grid = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    total = len(flat_grid)
    probabilities = {symbol: flat_grid.count(symbol) / total for symbol in set(flat_grid)}
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities.values() if p > 0)

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
coffee.brew()
entropy = calculate_entropy(coffee.grid)
print(f"System entropy: {entropy}")
```

Slide 12: Feedback Loops and Self-Organization

Complex systems often exhibit feedback loops and self-organization. In our Coffee Automaton, we can model this by introducing rules that create reinforcing or balancing effects.

```python
def self_organize(self):
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in self.grid]
    for i in range(self.size):
        for j in range(self.size):
            neighbors = self.count_neighbors(i, j)
            if self.grid[i][j] == 'C':
                if neighbors['W'] > 2:  # Coffee dissolves if surrounded by water
                    new_grid[i][j] = 'W'
            elif self.grid[i][j] == 'W':
                if neighbors['C'] > 3:  # Water becomes coffee if surrounded by coffee
                    new_grid[i][j] = 'C'
    self.grid = new_grid

def count_neighbors(self, i, j):
    neighbors = {'C': 0, 'W': 0, ' ': 0}
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if di == 0 and dj == 0:
                continue
            ni, nj = (i + di) % self.size, (j + dj) % self.size
            neighbors[self.grid[ni][nj]] += 1
    return neighbors

CoffeeAutomaton.self_organize = self_organize
CoffeeAutomaton.count_neighbors = count_neighbors

coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(10)
coffee.brew()
print("Before self-organization:")
coffee.display()
coffee.self_organize()
print("After self-organization:")
coffee.display()
```

Slide 13: Analyzing Phase Transitions

Complex systems often undergo phase transitions, where the system's behavior changes dramatically. In our Coffee Automaton, we can look for these transitions by analyzing how the system's properties change over time.

```python
def analyze_phase_transitions(size, steps):
    coffee = CoffeeAutomaton(size)
    complexities = []
    entropies = []
    
    for _ in range(steps):
        coffee.brew()
        coffee.cool_and_mix()
        coffee.self_organize()
        complexities.append(calculate_complexity(coffee.grid))
        entropies.append(calculate_entropy(coffee.grid))
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
    plt.plot(range(steps), complexities)
    plt.ylabel('Complexity')
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
    plt.plot(range(steps), entropies)
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Entropy')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

analyze_phase_transitions(10, 100)
```

Slide 14: Limitations and Future Directions

While the Coffee Automaton provides insights into complexity in closed systems, it has limitations. Future work could explore open systems, multi-scale interactions, and more realistic physical models. These extensions could provide deeper insights into complex systems in nature and society.

```python
class ExtendedCoffeeAutomaton(CoffeeAutomaton):
    def __init__(self, size, open_system=False, multi_scale=False):
        super().__init__(size)
        self.open_system = open_system
        self.multi_scale = multi_scale
    
    def step(self):
        self.brew()
        self.cool_and_mix()
        self.self_organize()
        if self.open_system:
            self.interact_with_environment()
        if self.multi_scale:
            self.update_large_scale_properties()
    
    def interact_with_environment(self):
        # Placeholder for open system interactions
        pass
    
    def update_large_scale_properties(self):
        # Placeholder for multi-scale interactions
        pass

# Example usage
extended_coffee = ExtendedCoffeeAutomaton(10, open_system=True, multi_scale=True)
extended_coffee.step()
```

Slide 15: Additional Resources
