## Tensor Broadcasting in PyTorch Using Python
Slide 1: 
Introduction to Tensor Broadcasting in PyTorch

Tensor broadcasting is a powerful feature in PyTorch that allows arithmetic operations to be performed on tensors with different shapes. It automatically expands the smaller tensor to match the shape of the larger tensor, enabling efficient and concise operations without the need for explicit tensor reshaping.

Code:

```python
import torch

# Example tensors
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasting in action
result = tensor1 + tensor2
print(result)
```

Slide 2: 
Broadcasting Rules

For broadcasting to work, the shapes of the tensors must be compatible. PyTorch follows specific rules to determine if broadcasting is possible. The trailing dimensions (from the right) of the tensors are compared, and the dimensions must either match or be 1.

Code:

```python
# Example tensors with compatible shapes
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasting allowed: tensor2 is broadcasted to match tensor1's shape
result = tensor1 + tensor2
print(result)
```

Slide 3: 
Broadcasting Example 1

In this example, we demonstrate broadcasting with tensors of different ranks. The scalar tensor is broadcasted to match the shape of the higher-rank tensor.

Code:

```python
# Scalar tensor
scalar = torch.tensor(2)

# 2D tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Broadcasting scalar to match tensor shape
result = scalar + tensor
print(result)
```

Slide 4: 
Broadcasting Example 2

Broadcasting can also be applied to tensors with different numbers of dimensions. PyTorch will insert singleton dimensions (dimensions with size 1) as needed to make the shapes compatible.

Code:

```python
# 1D tensor
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])

# 3D tensor
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[[1], [2], [3]]])

# Broadcasting tensor1 to match tensor2's shape
result = tensor1 + tensor2
print(result)
```

Slide 5: 
Broadcasting Limitations

While broadcasting is a powerful feature, it has limitations. If the shapes of the tensors are not compatible after applying the broadcasting rules, PyTorch will raise a `RuntimeError`.

Code:

```python
# Incompatible tensor shapes
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasting not possible due to incompatible shapes
try:
    result = tensor1 + tensor2
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)
```

Slide 6: 
Vectorized Operations with Broadcasting

Broadcasting enables efficient and concise implementations of vectorized operations, where a single operation can be applied to entire tensors instead of iterating over individual elements.

Code:

```python
# Example data
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
weights = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.8])

# Vectorized operation with broadcasting
weighted_sum = (data * weights).sum(dim=1)
print(weighted_sum)
```

Slide 7: 
Broadcasting in Mathematical Operations

Broadcasting is not limited to arithmetic operations. It can also be used with various mathematical functions and operations provided by PyTorch, such as trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms.

Code:

```python
# 2D tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Broadcasting with mathematical operations
result = torch.log(tensor)
print(result)
```

Slide 8: 
Broadcasting and NumPy Compatibility

PyTorch's broadcasting rules are compatible with those of NumPy, ensuring seamless interoperability between the two libraries. This compatibility facilitates code sharing and enables the use of existing NumPy code with PyTorch tensors.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# NumPy array
np_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# PyTorch tensor
torch_tensor = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasting between NumPy array and PyTorch tensor
result = np_array + torch_tensor
print(result)
```

Slide 9: 
Broadcasting and Automatic Differentiation

Broadcasting works seamlessly with PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities. Gradients are computed correctly for broadcasted operations, enabling efficient training and optimization of deep learning models.

Code:

```python
# Tensors with different shapes
tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], requires_grad=True)
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasted operation
result = tensor1 * tensor2

# Compute gradients
result.sum().backward()

# Access gradients
print(tensor1.grad)
```

Slide 10: 
Broadcasting Best Practices

While broadcasting can simplify tensor operations, it's essential to be mindful of its implications on memory usage and performance. For large tensors or complex computations, it's recommended to carefully consider the memory requirements and potential performance bottlenecks.

Code:

```python
# Large tensors
large_tensor1 = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
large_tensor2 = torch.randn(1000, 1)

# Broadcasting can be memory-intensive
result = large_tensor1 + large_tensor2

# Consider alternative approaches if memory usage is a concern
```

Slide 11: 
Broadcasting and CUDA Tensors

Broadcasting works seamlessly with CUDA tensors, allowing efficient computations on GPU hardware. PyTorch automatically handles the necessary data transfers and computations, enabling high-performance tensor operations with broadcasting.

Code:

```python
# CUDA tensors
cuda_tensor1 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], device='cuda')
cuda_tensor2 = torch.tensor([[1], [2], [3]], device='cuda')

# Broadcasted operation on CUDA tensors
result = cuda_tensor1 + cuda_tensor2
print(result)
```

Slide 12: 
Advanced Broadcasting Use Cases

Broadcasting can be leveraged in advanced scenarios, such as applying operations to batches of data or constructing complex neural network architectures. Its flexibility and efficiency make it a powerful tool in various domains, including deep learning, scientific computing, and signal processing.

Code:

```python
# Batch data
batch_size = 32
input_size = 28 * 28
hidden_size = 128

# Broadcasting in neural network layers
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
weights = torch.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
biases = torch.randn(1, hidden_size)

# Broadcasted operation in neural network forward pass
outputs = inputs @ weights + biases
```

Slide 13: 
Broadcasting Pitfalls and Debugging

While broadcasting can simplify tensor operations, it can also introduce subtle bugs if not used carefully. It's essential to double-check tensor shapes and broadcasting behavior, especially when working with complex computations or combining multiple operations.

Code:

```python
# Example of a potential broadcasting pitfall
tensor1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor2 = torch.randn(1, 4)
tensor3 = torch.randn(3, 1)

# Unintended broadcasting behavior
result = tensor1 + tensor2 + tensor3

# Debugging by checking shapes and printing intermediate results
print(tensor1.shape, tensor2.shape, tensor3.shape)
print(tensor1 + tensor2)
print(result)
```
