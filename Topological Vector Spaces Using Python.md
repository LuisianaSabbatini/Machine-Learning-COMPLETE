## Topological Vector Spaces Using Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Topological Vector Spaces

Topological vector spaces are a fundamental concept in functional analysis, combining linear algebra with topology. They provide a framework for studying infinite-dimensional vector spaces equipped with a topology compatible with vector operations.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_vector_space(vectors):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    for v in vectors:
        plt.arrow(0, 0, v[0], v[1], head_width=0.1, head_length=0.1)
    plt.xlim(-5, 5)
    plt.ylim(-5, 5)
    plt.axhline(y=0, color='k')
    plt.axvline(x=0, color='k')
    plt.title("2D Vector Space Visualization")
    plt.show()

vectors = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 1], [-2, 2], [0, -3]])
visualize_vector_space(vectors)
```

Slide 2: Definition of a Topological Vector Space

A topological vector space is a vector space V over a topological field F (usually the real or complex numbers) with a topology such that vector addition and scalar multiplication are continuous functions.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define symbolic variables
V, W = sp.symbols('V W')
a, b = sp.symbols('a b')

# Define vector addition and scalar multiplication
vector_addition = V + W
scalar_multiplication = a * V

print("Vector addition:", vector_addition)
print("Scalar multiplication:", scalar_multiplication)
```

Slide 3: Continuity in Topological Vector Spaces

Continuity in topological vector spaces ensures that small changes in inputs result in small changes in outputs for vector operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_continuous(f, x0, epsilon=1e-6):
    x = np.linspace(x0 - epsilon, x0 + epsilon, 1000)
    y = f(x)
    return np.all(np.abs(y - f(x0)) < epsilon)

# Example continuous function
f = lambda x: x**2
x0 = 1

print(f"Is f(x) = x^2 continuous at x0 = {x0}?", is_continuous(f, x0))
```

Slide 4: Neighborhoods and Open Sets

In topological vector spaces, neighborhoods and open sets play crucial roles in defining the topology. A neighborhood of a point is an open set containing that point.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def plot_neighborhood(center, radius):
    theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
    x = center[0] + radius * np.cos(theta)
    y = center[1] + radius * np.sin(theta)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.scatter(center[0], center[1], color='red', s=50)
    plt.title(f"Neighborhood of point {center} with radius {radius}")
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

center = (2, 3)
radius = 1.5
plot_neighborhood(center, radius)
```

Slide 5: Bases and Subbases

A base for a topology is a collection of open sets such that every open set can be written as a union of members of the base. A subbase is a collection of open sets whose union of all finite intersections forms a base.

```python
def is_base(sets, universe):
    def powerset(s):
        return set(frozenset(s) for s in powerset_helper(s))
    
    def powerset_helper(s):
        if len(s) == 0:
            yield []
        else:
            for subset in powerset_helper(s[1:]):
                yield subset
                yield [s[0]] + subset
    
    all_unions = set()
    for subset in powerset(sets):
        all_unions.add(frozenset().union(*subset))
    
    return frozenset(universe) in all_unions

# Example
universe = {1, 2, 3, 4}
base_sets = [{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}]

print("Is the given collection a base?", is_base(base_sets, universe))
```

Slide 6: Separation Axioms

Separation axioms in topological vector spaces define how well-behaved the space is in terms of separating distinct points. The most common separation axioms are T0, T1, and T2 (Hausdorff).

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_topology_graph(points, open_sets):
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_nodes_from(points)
    for s in open_sets:
        for i in s:
            for j in s:
                if i != j:
                    G.add_edge(i, j)
    return G

points = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
open_sets = [{'a', 'b'}, {'b', 'c'}, {'c', 'd'}, {'a', 'd'}]

G = create_topology_graph(points, open_sets)
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, font_size=16)
plt.title("Graph representation of a topology")
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Compactness in Topological Vector Spaces

A topological vector space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Compactness is a crucial property in functional analysis and optimization theory.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def is_compact(points, epsilon=0.1):
    min_x, max_x = np.min(points[:, 0]), np.max(points[:, 0])
    min_y, max_y = np.min(points[:, 1]), np.max(points[:, 1])
    
    x_range = max_x - min_x
    y_range = max_y - min_y
    
    return x_range < epsilon and y_range < epsilon

# Generate random points
np.random.seed(42)
points = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# Plot the points
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.scatter(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
plt.title(f"Is the set compact? {is_compact(points)}")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("Y")
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Connectedness

A topological vector space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Connectedness is important in studying continuous functions and their properties.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def is_connected(graph):
    return nx.is_connected(graph)

# Create a sample graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1)])

# Check if the graph is connected
connected = is_connected(G)

# Visualize the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, font_size=16)
plt.title(f"Is the graph connected? {connected}")
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Normed Vector Spaces

Normed vector spaces are an important subclass of topological vector spaces, where the topology is induced by a norm. The norm defines a notion of distance and magnitude for vectors.

```python
import numpy as np

class NormedVectorSpace:
    def __init__(self, vector):
        self.vector = np.array(vector)
    
    def l1_norm(self):
        return np.sum(np.abs(self.vector))
    
    def l2_norm(self):
        return np.sqrt(np.sum(self.vector**2))
    
    def lp_norm(self, p):
        return np.sum(np.abs(self.vector)**p)**(1/p)

v = NormedVectorSpace([3, 4])
print(f"L1 norm: {v.l1_norm()}")
print(f"L2 norm: {v.l2_norm()}")
print(f"L3 norm: {v.lp_norm(3)}")
```

Slide 10: Banach Spaces

Banach spaces are complete normed vector spaces, meaning that every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in the space. They are fundamental in functional analysis and have numerous applications.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_cauchy(sequence, epsilon=1e-6):
    n = len(sequence)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if abs(sequence[i] - sequence[j]) > epsilon:
                return False
    return True

def is_convergent(sequence, epsilon=1e-6):
    return np.all(np.abs(np.diff(sequence)) < epsilon)

# Example sequence
sequence = [1/n for n in range(1, 101)]

print(f"Is the sequence Cauchy? {is_cauchy(sequence)}")
print(f"Does the sequence converge? {is_convergent(sequence)}")
```

Slide 11: Hilbert Spaces

Hilbert spaces are complete inner product spaces, combining the structure of vector spaces with the notion of orthogonality. They are essential in quantum mechanics and signal processing.

```python
import numpy as np

class HilbertSpace:
    def __init__(self, vector):
        self.vector = np.array(vector)
    
    def inner_product(self, other):
        return np.dot(self.vector, other.vector)
    
    def norm(self):
        return np.sqrt(self.inner_product(self))
    
    def is_orthogonal(self, other):
        return np.isclose(self.inner_product(other), 0)

v1 = HilbertSpace([1, 0, 0])
v2 = HilbertSpace([0, 1, 0])

print(f"Inner product: {v1.inner_product(v2)}")
print(f"Norm of v1: {v1.norm()}")
print(f"Are v1 and v2 orthogonal? {v1.is_orthogonal(v2)}")
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Signal Processing

Topological vector spaces are crucial in signal processing, where signals are often represented as elements of function spaces. Here's an example of how we might use a Hilbert space to process audio signals.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_signal(freq, duration, sample_rate):
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sample_rate * duration), endpoint=False)
    return np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * t)

def plot_signals(signal1, signal2, title):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(signal1, label='Signal 1')
    plt.plot(signal2, label='Signal 2')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Generate two signals
signal1 = generate_signal(440, 0.1, 44100)  # A4 note
signal2 = generate_signal(261.63, 0.1, 44100)  # C4 note

# Calculate inner product
inner_product = np.dot(signal1, signal2)

plot_signals(signal1, signal2, f"Two Audio Signals (Inner Product: {inner_product:.2f})")
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is represented by a vector in a complex Hilbert space. Here's a simple example demonstrating the superposition principle using a two-state quantum system.

```python
import numpy as np

class QuantumState:
    def __init__(self, coefficients):
        self.coefficients = np.array(coefficients, dtype=complex)
        self.normalize()
    
    def normalize(self):
        norm = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.abs(self.coefficients)**2))
        self.coefficients /= norm
    
    def measure(self):
        probabilities = np.abs(self.coefficients)**2
        return np.random.choice(len(self.coefficients), p=probabilities)

# Create a superposition state
psi = QuantumState([1, 1])  # |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2

# Perform measurements
measurements = [psi.measure() for _ in range(1000)]

print("Measurement results:")
print(f"State |0⟩: {measurements.count(0)}")
print(f"State |1⟩: {measurements.count(1)}")
```
