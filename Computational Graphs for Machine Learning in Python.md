## Computational Graphs for Machine Learning in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Computational Graphs in Machine Learning

Computational graphs are powerful tools for representing and optimizing complex mathematical operations in machine learning. They form the backbone of modern deep learning frameworks, allowing efficient computation and automatic differentiation. In this presentation, we'll explore the concept of computational graphs and their implementation using Python.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple computational graph
a = tf.constant(3.0)
b = tf.constant(4.0)
c = a * b

print(c)  # Output: tf.Tensor(12.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

Slide 2: Building Blocks of Computational Graphs

Computational graphs consist of nodes (operations) and edges (data flow). Nodes represent mathematical operations or variables, while edges represent the flow of data between nodes. This structure allows for efficient computation and automatic differentiation, which is crucial for training neural networks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create nodes (operations and variables)
x = tf.Variable(2.0)
y = tf.Variable(3.0)
z = x * y + tf.square(x)

# Compute the result
result = z.numpy()
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Output: Result: 10.0
```

Slide 3: Forward Pass in Computational Graphs

The forward pass in a computational graph involves traversing the graph from input nodes to output nodes, computing the values at each node along the way. This process is essential for making predictions in machine learning models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def forward_pass(x):
    # Define the computational graph
    w1 = tf.Variable(2.0)
    b1 = tf.Variable(1.0)
    w2 = tf.Variable(3.0)
    b2 = tf.Variable(0.5)
    
    # Perform forward pass
    layer1 = tf.nn.relu(w1 * x + b1)
    output = w2 * layer1 + b2
    
    return output

# Example usage
input_value = tf.constant(1.5)
result = forward_pass(input_value)
print(f"Forward pass result: {result.numpy()}")
# Output: Forward pass result: 10.0
```

Slide 4: Automatic Differentiation in Computational Graphs

One of the key advantages of computational graphs is automatic differentiation. This allows us to efficiently compute gradients of complex functions, which is crucial for training machine learning models using gradient-based optimization algorithms.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a function
def f(x):
    return tf.square(x) + 2*x - 5

# Compute the gradient
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.Variable(3.0)
    y = f(x)

gradient = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(f"Gradient of f(x) at x = 3: {gradient.numpy()}")
# Output: Gradient of f(x) at x = 3: 8.0
```

Slide 5: Backpropagation in Computational Graphs

Backpropagation is an algorithm that efficiently computes gradients in computational graphs. It works by propagating error gradients backwards through the graph, from the output to the input, using the chain rule of calculus.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Generate some dummy data
x = tf.random.normal((100, 1))
y = 2 * x + 1 + tf.random.normal((100, 1), stddev=0.1)

# Train the model (backpropagation happens here)
history = model.fit(x, y, epochs=50, verbose=0)

print(f"Final loss: {history.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")
# Output will vary, but should show a decreasing loss
```

Slide 6: Optimization in Computational Graphs

Optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), use the gradients computed through backpropagation to update the model parameters. This process minimizes the loss function and improves the model's performance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple function to optimize
def f(x):
    return (x - 2) ** 2

# Create a variable to optimize
x = tf.Variable(5.0)

# Define an optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

# Optimization loop
for step in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = f(x)
    
    # Compute gradients
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [x])
    
    # Apply gradients
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [x]))

    if step % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Step {step}: x = {x.numpy():.4f}, loss = {loss.numpy():.4f}")

# Output will show x converging to 2 and loss decreasing
```

Slide 7: Real-life Example: Image Classification

Let's look at a real-life example of using computational graphs for image classification. We'll use a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_split=0.1, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
# Output will vary, but should show high accuracy (> 0.95)
```

Slide 8: Visualizing Computational Graphs

Visualizing computational graphs can help in understanding the structure of complex models. TensorFlow provides tools to create these visualizations, which can be especially useful for debugging and optimizing large neural networks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Create a dummy input
dummy_input = np.random.random((1, 3))

# Use tf.summary.trace_on to trace operations
tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True, profiler=True)

# Make a prediction (this will be traced)
_ = model(dummy_input)

# Create a log writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs')

# Write the graph
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.trace_export(name="model_trace", step=0, profiler_outdir='logs')

print("Graph visualization saved. Use TensorBoard to view.")
# To view: tensorboard --logdir logs
```

Slide 9: Computational Graphs in PyTorch

While we've focused on TensorFlow, it's worth noting that PyTorch also uses computational graphs, but in a dynamic manner. Let's look at a simple example to illustrate the difference.

```python
import torch

# Define a simple function
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x - 5

# Create a tensor with gradient tracking
x = torch.tensor([3.0], requires_grad=True)

# Compute the function
y = f(x)

# Compute the gradient
y.backward()

print(f"Gradient of f(x) at x = 3: {x.grad.item()}")
# Output: Gradient of f(x) at x = 3: 8.0
```

Slide 10: Graph Optimization Techniques

Computational graph frameworks often employ various optimization techniques to improve performance. These may include constant folding, common subexpression elimination, and operation fusion. Let's look at a simple example of constant folding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Without constant folding
a = tf.constant(3.0)
b = tf.constant(4.0)
c = a * b

print("Without constant folding:")
print(tf.autograph.to_code(lambda: a * b))

# With constant folding (happens automatically in graph mode)
@tf.function
def multiplied():
    return a * b

print("\nWith constant folding:")
print(tf.autograph.to_code(multiplied.python_function))

# Output will show the difference in generated code
```

Slide 11: Real-life Example: Natural Language Processing

Let's explore another real-life example, this time in the domain of Natural Language Processing. We'll create a simple sentiment analysis model using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the IMDB movie review dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import sequence

# Load the IMDB dataset
max_features = 10000
maxlen = 200
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max_features)

# Pad sequences
x_train = sequence.pad_sequences(x_train, maxlen=maxlen)
x_test = sequence.pad_sequences(x_test, maxlen=maxlen)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(max_features, 128),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
# Output will vary, but should show good accuracy (> 0.80)
```

Slide 12: Handling Large Datasets with Computational Graphs

When dealing with large datasets that don't fit in memory, we can use dataset iterators and data pipelines. These integrate seamlessly with computational graphs, allowing efficient processing of large-scale data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a large dataset
def generate_data():
    while True:
        yield np.random.randn(100, 5), np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1))

# Create a tf.data.Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    generate_data,
    output_types=(tf.float32, tf.int32),
    output_shapes=((100, 5), (100, 1))
)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model using the dataset
history = model.fit(dataset, steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=5, verbose=0)

print(f"Final loss: {history.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")
print(f"Final accuracy: {history.history['accuracy'][-1]:.4f}")
# Output will vary, but should show decreasing loss and increasing accuracy
```

Slide 13: Debugging Computational Graphs

Debugging computational graphs can be challenging due to their abstract nature. TensorFlow provides tools like tf.debugging to help identify issues in your graphs. Let's look at an example of using these tools.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a function with a potential issue
@tf.function
def buggy_function(x):
    if tf.reduce_sum(x) > 0:
        return x
    else:
        return tf.zeros_like(x)

# Create some test inputs
test_inputs = [tf.constant([1.0, 2.0]), tf.constant([-1.0, -2.0])]

# Use tf.debugging.check_numerics to catch NaN or Inf values
for i, x in enumerate(test_inputs):
    with tf.debugging.check_numerics_ops():
        result = buggy_function(x)
    print(f"Input {i}: {x.numpy()}, Output: {result.numpy()}")

# Additional debugging technique: enable eager execution for step-by-step debugging
tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)
for i, x in enumerate(test_inputs):
    result = buggy_function(x)
    print(f"Eager execution - Input {i}: {x.numpy()}, Output: {result.numpy()}")

# Output will show the function's behavior for different inputs
```

Slide 14: Performance Optimization in Computational Graphs

Optimizing the performance of computational graphs involves techniques like graph simplification, operation fusion, and hardware-specific optimizations. TensorFlow's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler is one example of such optimization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Define a simple operation
def compute_intensive_op(x, y):
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.matmul(x, tf.transpose(y)))

# Create large tensors
large_tensor1 = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
large_tensor2 = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))

# Time the operation without XLA
start_time = time.time()
result = compute_intensive_op(large_tensor1, large_tensor2)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time without XLA: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Enable XLA
tf.config.optimizer.set_jit(True)

# Time the operation with XLA
start_time = time.time()
result = compute_intensive_op(large_tensor1, large_tensor2)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Time with XLA: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Output will show the performance difference (XLA should be faster)
```
