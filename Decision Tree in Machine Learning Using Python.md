## Decision Tree in Machine Learning Using Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They are tree-like models where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction. Decision Trees are easy to interpret, handle both numerical and categorical data, and can capture non-linear relationships.

Code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model
dt_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = dt_clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Slide 2: Decision Tree Construction

Decision Trees are constructed in a recursive manner by partitioning the data into subsets based on the feature values. The process starts with the entire dataset and continues splitting the data based on the feature that provides the best separation of the classes or target variable. This is done using impurity measures like Gini impurity or entropy.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=2, n_features=2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
dt_clf.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the decision boundaries
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, cmap='bwr', edgecolor='k')
plt.scatter(dt_clf.tree_.value[:, 0, 0], dt_clf.tree_.value[:, 0, 1], c='r', marker='x')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Decision Tree Hyperparameters

Decision Trees have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. Some important hyperparameters are max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, and max\_features. Proper tuning of these hyperparameters is crucial for achieving good performance.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
}

# Create a Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters
grid_search = GridSearchCV(dt_clf, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding accuracy score
print("Best Hyperparameters: ", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best Accuracy: ", grid_search.best_score_)
```

Slide 4: Handling Missing Data

Decision Trees can handle missing data naturally by incorporating a missing value branch in the tree during construction. This is done by evaluating the impurity measure for both splitting on the feature and assigning the missing values to one of the branches.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with missing values
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=2, n_features=5, random_state=42)
X[np.random.randint(X.shape[0], size=100), np.random.randint(X.shape[1], size=100)] = np.nan

# Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt_clf.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions on new data with missing values
new_data = np.array([[1.2, np.nan, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8], [np.nan, 2.3, 4.5, 6.7, np.nan]])
predictions = dt_clf.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
```

Slide 5: Feature Importance

Decision Trees provide a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for understanding the relative importance of each feature in making predictions. Feature importance is calculated based on the decrease in impurity achieved by splitting on that feature, weighted by the number of samples the feature splits.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt_clf.fit(X, y)

# Get the feature importances
feature_importances = dt_clf.feature_importances_

# Plot the feature importances
plt.bar(range(len(iris.feature_names)), feature_importances)
plt.xticks(range(len(iris.feature_names)), iris.feature_names, rotation=90)
plt.xlabel('Features')
plt.ylabel('Importance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Pruning Decision Trees

Pruning is a technique used to prevent overfitting in Decision Trees. It involves removing some of the branches or nodes from the fully grown tree based on certain criteria, such as the number of samples or the depth of the node. Pruning can improve the generalization performance of the model by reducing the complexity of the tree.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
dt_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prune the tree
prune_path = dt_clf.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_test, y_test)
alphas = prune_path.ccp_alphas

# Find the best alpha for pruning
best_alpha = alphas[np.argmax(prune_path.ccp_alphas)]

# Prune the tree using the best alpha
dt_clf_pruned = DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=best_alpha)
dt_clf_pruned.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 7: Decision Tree Ensembles

Decision Tree Ensembles are methods that combine multiple Decision Trees to improve the predictive performance and reduce the variance of the model. Popular ensemble methods include Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees. These methods train multiple Decision Trees on different subsets of the data or with different hyperparameters and combine their predictions using techniques like averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification).

Ensemble methods can help mitigate the limitations of individual Decision Trees, such as overfitting and instability, by introducing randomness and diversity in the model construction process. The diversity among the individual trees is crucial for the ensemble to perform well, and it is achieved through techniques like bootstrapping the training data, random feature selection, and random splitting.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic regression data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_informative=5, random_state=42)

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the ensemble models
rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

gb_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

et_reg = ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
et_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_rf = rf_reg.predict(X_test)
y_pred_gb = gb_reg.predict(X_test)
y_pred_et = et_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the models
print("Random Forest RMSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_rf, squared=False))
print("Gradient Boosting RMSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_gb, squared=False))
print("Extra Trees RMSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_et, squared=False))
```

This code demonstrates the usage of three different ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees) for a regression task. It generates synthetic data, splits it into train and test sets, creates and trains the ensemble models, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the performance using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.


Slide 8: Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees trained on random subsets of the data and features. Each tree in the forest is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each node, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Random Forest Classifier
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Slide 9: Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak Decision Tree models in an iterative and additive manner. Each new tree is trained to improve the predictions of the previous trees by focusing on the instances that were misclassified or had high residuals. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions from all the trees.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Gradient Boosting Classifier
gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = gb_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Slide 10: Extremely Randomized Trees

Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra-Trees) is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees trained on random subsets of the data and features, similar to Random Forests. However, in Extra-Trees, the splitting at each node is done by randomly selecting a feature and a split value, rather than choosing the best split based on an impurity measure.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Extra-Trees Classifier
et_clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
et_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = et_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Slide 13: Decision Tree Visualization

Decision Trees can be visualized to better understand the structure of the model and the decision rules learned from the data. This can be done using various libraries in Python, such as scikit-learn, graphviz, and matplotlib.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn import tree
import graphviz

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
dt_clf.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the Decision Tree
dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(dt_clf, out_file=None,
                                feature_names=iris.feature_names,
                                class_names=iris.target_names,
                                filled=True, rounded=True)
graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
graph.render("decision_tree")
```
