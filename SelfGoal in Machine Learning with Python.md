## SelfGoal in Machine Learning with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to SelfGoal in Machine Learning

SelfGoal is a novel approach in machine learning that focuses on self-supervised learning and goal-oriented behavior. It aims to create models that can autonomously set and pursue their own goals, leading to more adaptable and efficient AI systems. This paradigm shift allows for more flexible and context-aware learning, potentially revolutionizing how we approach artificial intelligence.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SelfGoalModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SelfGoalModel, self).__init__()
        self.goal_generator = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.task_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size + hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        goal = self.goal_generator(x)
        combined_input = torch.cat((x, goal), dim=1)
        return self.task_network(combined_input)

# Example usage
model = SelfGoalModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_data)
print(output)
```

Slide 2: Self-Supervised Learning in SelfGoal

Self-supervised learning is a key component of SelfGoal. It enables the model to learn from unlabeled data by creating its own supervisory signals. This approach allows the model to extract meaningful representations from the data without explicit human labeling, making it more scalable and adaptable to various domains.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SelfSupervisedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SelfSupervisedModel, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = self.encoder(x)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return encoded, decoded

# Training loop
model = SelfSupervisedModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

for epoch in range(100):
    input_data = torch.randn(32, 10)  # Batch of 32 samples
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    _, reconstructed = model(input_data)
    loss = criterion(reconstructed, input_data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Final loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Slide 3: Goal Generation in SelfGoal

Goal generation is a crucial aspect of SelfGoal, where the model learns to create meaningful and achievable objectives. This process involves analyzing the current state, predicting future states, and formulating goals that lead to desired outcomes. The generated goals guide the model's learning and decision-making processes.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class GoalGenerator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, goal_size):
        super(GoalGenerator, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, goal_size)
        )

    def forward(self, state):
        return self.network(state)

# Example usage
state_size = 10
goal_size = 5
generator = GoalGenerator(state_size, goal_size)

current_state = torch.randn(1, state_size)
generated_goal = generator(current_state)

print("Current State:", current_state)
print("Generated Goal:", generated_goal)
```

Slide 4: Reward Shaping in SelfGoal

Reward shaping is an essential technique in SelfGoal that helps guide the learning process. It involves designing reward functions that encourage the model to pursue meaningful goals and learn useful behaviors. By carefully crafting these reward signals, we can steer the model towards desired outcomes and improve its overall performance.

```python
import numpy as np

def shaped_reward(state, action, next_state, goal):
    # Base reward for reaching the goal
    base_reward = 1.0 if np.allclose(next_state, goal, atol=0.1) else 0.0
    
    # Shaping term: reward progress towards the goal
    distance_to_goal = np.linalg.norm(state - goal)
    new_distance_to_goal = np.linalg.norm(next_state - goal)
    shaping_reward = distance_to_goal - new_distance_to_goal
    
    # Combine base reward and shaping term
    total_reward = base_reward + 0.5 * shaping_reward
    
    return total_reward

# Example usage
state = np.array([0, 0, 0])
action = np.array([1, 0, 0])
next_state = np.array([1, 0, 0])
goal = np.array([5, 0, 0])

reward = shaped_reward(state, action, next_state, goal)
print(f"Shaped Reward: {reward}")
```

Slide 5: Hierarchical Goal Structures

SelfGoal often employs hierarchical goal structures to manage complex tasks. This approach breaks down high-level objectives into smaller, more manageable subgoals. By organizing goals hierarchically, the model can tackle intricate problems more efficiently and learn to generalize across different task domains.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class HierarchicalGoalNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_levels):
        super(HierarchicalGoalNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.num_levels = num_levels
        self.goal_networks = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(input_size + i * hidden_size, hidden_size),
                nn.ReLU(),
                nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
            ) for i in range(num_levels)
        ])

    def forward(self, x):
        goals = []
        for i in range(self.num_levels):
            if i == 0:
                goal = self.goal_networks[i](x)
            else:
                combined_input = torch.cat([x] + goals, dim=1)
                goal = self.goal_networks[i](combined_input)
            goals.append(goal)
        return goals

# Example usage
model = HierarchicalGoalNetwork(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_levels=3)
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
hierarchical_goals = model(input_data)

for i, goal in enumerate(hierarchical_goals):
    print(f"Level {i+1} Goal:", goal)
```

Slide 6: Meta-Learning in SelfGoal

Meta-learning, or learning to learn, is a powerful concept integrated into SelfGoal. It enables the model to adapt quickly to new tasks by leveraging knowledge gained from previous experiences. This approach enhances the model's flexibility and generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform well in novel situations with minimal additional training.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MetaLearner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MetaLearner, self).__init__()
        self.base_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )
        self.meta_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size + output_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x, task_embedding):
        base_output = self.base_network(x)
        combined_input = torch.cat((x, task_embedding), dim=1)
        meta_output = self.meta_network(combined_input)
        return base_output + meta_output

# Example usage
model = MetaLearner(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Simulated meta-learning loop
for task in range(5):
    task_embedding = torch.randn(1, 5)  # Simulated task embedding
    for _ in range(10):  # Inner loop for task-specific learning
        input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
        output = model(input_data, task_embedding)
        loss = torch.sum((output - torch.randn(1, 5))**2)  # Simulated loss
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Task {task+1} final loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Slide 7: Intrinsic Motivation in SelfGoal

Intrinsic motivation is a key driver in SelfGoal systems, encouraging exploration and learning without external rewards. This internal drive helps the model discover novel states and behaviors, leading to more robust and versatile learning. Implementing intrinsic motivation can significantly enhance the model's ability to adapt to new environments and tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

class IntrinsicMotivationAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.novelty_memory = {}
        self.novelty_threshold = 0.1

    def compute_novelty(self, state):
        state_key = tuple(state)
        if state_key in self.novelty_memory:
            return 0
        else:
            self.novelty_memory[state_key] = 1
            return 1

    def get_intrinsic_reward(self, state, action, next_state):
        novelty = self.compute_novelty(next_state)
        prediction_error = np.random.rand()  # Simulated prediction error
        intrinsic_reward = novelty + 0.5 * prediction_error
        return intrinsic_reward

# Example usage
agent = IntrinsicMotivationAgent(state_size=3, action_size=2)

for _ in range(5):
    state = np.random.rand(3)
    action = np.random.randint(2)
    next_state = np.random.rand(3)
    
    intrinsic_reward = agent.get_intrinsic_reward(state, action, next_state)
    print(f"Intrinsic Reward: {intrinsic_reward}")
```

Slide 8: Curriculum Learning in SelfGoal

Curriculum learning is an important strategy in SelfGoal, where the model progressively tackles increasingly complex tasks. This approach mimics human learning patterns, starting with simpler concepts before moving on to more challenging ones. By carefully designing the learning curriculum, we can improve the model's efficiency and performance on difficult tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CurriculumLearner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(CurriculumLearner, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.network(x)

def generate_task(difficulty):
    # Simulated task generation with increasing difficulty
    return torch.randn(10) * difficulty, torch.randn(5) * difficulty

# Training loop with curriculum
model = CurriculumLearner(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

difficulties = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0]
epochs_per_difficulty = 100

for difficulty in difficulties:
    print(f"Training on difficulty level: {difficulty}")
    for epoch in range(epochs_per_difficulty):
        input_data, target = generate_task(difficulty)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(input_data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Final loss for difficulty {difficulty}: {loss.item()}")
```

Slide 9: Transfer Learning in SelfGoal

Transfer learning is a crucial aspect of SelfGoal, allowing the model to apply knowledge gained from one task to another related task. This capability significantly reduces the amount of data and time required to learn new skills. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, SelfGoal systems can quickly adapt to new domains and challenges.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import models, transforms

# Pre-trained model
pretrained_model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze the pre-trained layers
for param in pretrained_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Modify the final layer for the new task
num_ftrs = pretrained_model.fc.in_features
pretrained_model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)  # 10 classes for the new task

# Fine-tuning
optimizer = optim.SGD(pretrained_model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Simulated training loop
for epoch in range(5):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i in range(100):  # Simulated batch iterations
        inputs = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)  # Simulated input data
        labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (32,))  # Simulated labels
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = pretrained_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        running_loss += loss.item()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {running_loss/100}")

print("Fine-tuning completed")
```

Slide 10: Exploration Strategies in SelfGoal

Effective exploration is crucial for SelfGoal systems to discover optimal solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima. Various exploration strategies can be employed to balance the trade-off between exploiting known good actions and exploring new possibilities. These strategies include epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling, and intrinsic motivation-based methods.

```python
import numpy as np

class ExplorationStrategy:
    def __init__(self, action_space, strategy='epsilon_greedy'):
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.decay_rate = 0.995

    def select_action(self, q_values):
        if self.strategy == 'epsilon_greedy':
            if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
                return np.random.choice(self.action_space)
            else:
                return np.argmax(q_values)
        elif self.strategy == 'thompson_sampling':
            return np.argmax(np.random.normal(q_values, 1.0))

    def update_parameters(self):
        if self.strategy == 'epsilon_greedy':
            self.epsilon *= self.decay_rate

# Example usage
action_space = 5
explorer = ExplorationStrategy(action_space, strategy='epsilon_greedy')

for episode in range(100):
    q_values = np.random.rand(action_space)  # Simulated Q-values
    action = explorer.select_action(q_values)
    explorer.update_parameters()
    print(f"Episode {episode+1}, Action: {action}, Epsilon: {explorer.epsilon:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning

Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is a key component of SelfGoal, allowing the model to learn policies that can achieve multiple goals. This approach enables the system to generalize across different objectives and adapt to new goals without retraining. By conditioning the policy on both the current state and the desired goal, the model learns to navigate towards various target states efficiently.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class GoalConditionedPolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, goal_dim, action_dim):
        super(GoalConditionedPolicy, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim + goal_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, action_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, state, goal):
        combined_input = torch.cat([state, goal], dim=1)
        return self.network(combined_input)

# Example usage
state_dim = 10
goal_dim = 5
action_dim = 3

policy = GoalConditionedPolicy(state_dim, goal_dim, action_dim)

state = torch.randn(1, state_dim)
goal = torch.randn(1, goal_dim)

action = policy(state, goal)
print("Generated action:", action)
```

Slide 12: Abstraction and Concept Learning in SelfGoal

Abstraction and concept learning are crucial for SelfGoal systems to develop higher-level understanding and generalization capabilities. By learning to identify and manipulate abstract concepts, the model can transfer knowledge across different domains and solve complex problems more efficiently. This process involves identifying common patterns, creating hierarchical representations, and forming general rules from specific examples.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

class ConceptLearner:
    def __init__(self, n_concepts):
        self.n_concepts = n_concepts
        self.kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_concepts)

    def learn_concepts(self, data):
        self.kmeans.fit(data)

    def assign_concept(self, sample):
        return self.kmeans.predict(sample.reshape(1, -1))[0]

    def generate_abstract_representation(self, sample):
        concept = self.assign_concept(sample)
        return self.kmeans.cluster_centers_[concept]

# Example usage
n_concepts = 5
data_dim = 10

learner = ConceptLearner(n_concepts)

# Generate synthetic data
data = np.random.rand(100, data_dim)

# Learn concepts
learner.learn_concepts(data)

# Test with a new sample
new_sample = np.random.rand(data_dim)
assigned_concept = learner.assign_concept(new_sample)
abstract_repr = learner.generate_abstract_representation(new_sample)

print("Assigned concept:", assigned_concept)
print("Abstract representation:", abstract_repr)
```

Slide 13: Continual Learning in SelfGoal

Continual learning is a critical aspect of SelfGoal, enabling the model to acquire new knowledge and skills over time without forgetting previously learned information. This capability allows the system to adapt to changing environments and tasks while maintaining its performance on earlier objectives. Techniques such as elastic weight consolidation, progressive neural networks, and memory replay are employed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and facilitate lifelong learning.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class ContinualLearner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_tasks):
        super(ContinualLearner, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.task_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1) for _ in range(num_tasks)])
        self.num_tasks = num_tasks

    def forward(self, x, task_id):
        x = torch.relu(self.shared_layer(x))
        return self.task_layers[task_id](x)

    def train_task(self, task_id, x, y, num_epochs=100):
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters())
        criterion = nn.MSELoss()

        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = self(x, task_id)
            loss = criterion(output, y)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
                print(f"Task {task_id + 1}, Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_tasks = 3

model = ContinualLearner(input_size, hidden_size, num_tasks)

for task_id in range(num_tasks):
    x = torch.randn(100, input_size)
    y = torch.randn(100, 1)
    model.train_task(task_id, x, y)

print("Continual learning completed for all tasks")
```

Slide 14: Real-life Example: Autonomous Robot Navigation

SelfGoal principles can be applied to autonomous robot navigation, where a robot learns to navigate complex environments and accomplish various tasks. The robot uses self-supervised learning to understand its surroundings, generates goals for exploration and task completion, and employs intrinsic motivation to encourage discovery of new areas.

```python
import numpy as np

class NavigationRobot:
    def __init__(self, map_size):
        self.position = np.array([0, 0])
        self.map = np.zeros(map_size)
        self.goal = None

    def set_random_goal(self):
        self.goal = np.random.randint(0, self.map.shape[0], 2)

    def move(self, action):
        self.position += action
        self.position = np.clip(self.position, 0, self.map.shape[0] - 1)
        self.map[tuple(self.position)] = 1

    def get_intrinsic_reward(self):
        return 1 if self.map[tuple(self.position)] == 0 else 0

    def get_extrinsic_reward(self):
        return 1 if np.all(self.position == self.goal) else 0

# Example usage
robot = NavigationRobot(map_size=(10, 10))
robot.set_random_goal()

for _ range(100):
    action = np.random.randint(-1, 2, 2)  # Random action
    robot.move(action)
    intrinsic_reward = robot.get_intrinsic_reward()
    extrinsic_reward = robot.get_extrinsic_reward()
    
    print(f"Position: {robot.position}, Intrinsic Reward: {intrinsic_reward}, Extrinsic Reward: {extrinsic_reward}")

    if extrinsic_reward > 0:
        print("Goal reached!")
        break

print("Exploration completed")
```

Slide 15: Real-life Example: Adaptive Personal Assistant

SelfGoal concepts can be applied to create an adaptive personal assistant that learns and evolves based on user interactions. The assistant sets goals to improve its performance, learns from user feedback, and continuously adapts its behavior to better serve the user's needs.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

class AdaptiveAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
        self.classifier = MultinomialNB()
        self.intents = ['weather', 'schedule', 'reminder', 'general']
        self.training_data = []
        self.training_labels = []

    def train(self):
        if len(self.training_data) > 0:
            X = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(self.training_data)
            self.classifier.fit(X, self.training_labels)

    def predict_intent(self, query):
        X = self.vectorizer.transform([query])
        return self.classifier.predict(X)[0]

    def update_model(self, query, correct_intent):
        self.training_data.append(query)
        self.training_labels.append(correct_intent)
        self.train()

# Example usage
assistant = AdaptiveAssistant()

# Initial training
initial_queries = [
    "What's the weather like today?",
    "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow",
    "Remind me to buy groceries",
    "Tell me a joke"
]
initial_intents = ['weather', 'schedule', 'reminder', 'general']

for query, intent in zip(initial_queries, initial_intents):
    assistant.update_model(query, intent)

# Interaction loop
for _ in range(5):
    user_query = input("Enter your query: ")
    predicted_intent = assistant.predict_intent(user_query)
    print(f"Predicted intent: {predicted_intent}")
    
    correct_intent = input("Enter the correct intent: ")
    assistant.update_model(user_query, correct_intent)
    print("Model updated")

print("Interaction completed")
