## Mastering Python Sets! Unlock Powerful Data Manipulation
Slide 1: Introduction to Python Sets

Python sets are unordered collections of unique elements, offering powerful tools for data manipulation and mathematical operations. They provide efficient ways to store and process distinct items, making them invaluable for various programming tasks.

```python
# Creating a set
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(fruits)  # Output: {'cherry', 'banana', 'apple'}

# Adding an element
fruits.add("date")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'cherry', 'banana', 'apple', 'date'}

# Trying to add a duplicate
fruits.add("apple")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'cherry', 'banana', 'apple', 'date'}
```

Slide 2: Set Creation and Basic Operations

Sets can be created using curly braces or the set() constructor. They support various operations like adding, removing, and checking for membership.

```python
# Creating sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = set([3, 4, 5])

# Basic operations
set1.add(4)
set2.remove(5)
print(3 in set1)  # Output: True

print(set1)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(set2)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Slide 3: Set Methods - Union

The union() method combines elements from two or more sets, creating a new set with all unique elements from all sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Alternative syntax using |
union_set_alt = set1 | set2
print(union_set_alt)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Slide 4: Set Methods - Intersection

The intersection() method returns a new set containing only the elements that are common to all sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Alternative syntax using &
intersection_set_alt = set1 & set2
print(intersection_set_alt)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

Slide 5: Set Methods - Difference

The difference() method returns a new set with elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Alternative syntax using -
difference_set_alt = set1 - set2
print(difference_set_alt)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

Slide 6: Set Methods - Symmetric Difference

The symmetric\_difference() method returns a new set with elements that are in either set, but not in both.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
sym_diff_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(sym_diff_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}

# Alternative syntax using ^
sym_diff_set_alt = set1 ^ set2
print(sym_diff_set_alt)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

Slide 7: Set Comprehension

Set comprehension allows creating sets using a compact syntax, similar to list comprehensions but with curly braces.

```python
# Create a set of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9
even_squares = {x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_squares)  # Output: {0, 64, 4, 36, 16}

# Create a set of unique characters in a string
unique_chars = {char.lower() for char in "Hello, World!"}
print(unique_chars)  # Output: {'l', 'd', 'h', 'r', 'w', ',', 'e', ' ', '!', 'o'}
```

Slide 8: Frozen Sets

Frozen sets are immutable versions of sets, created using the frozenset() constructor. They can be used as dictionary keys or as elements of other sets.

```python
# Creating a frozen set
frozen = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(frozen)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})

# Attempting to modify a frozen set (will raise an error)
try:
    frozen.add(5)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'

# Using a frozen set as a dictionary key
dict_with_frozenset = {frozen: "This is a frozen set"}
print(dict_with_frozenset[frozen])  # Output: This is a frozen set
```

Slide 9: Set Operations and Mathematical Set Theory

Python sets implement mathematical set operations, making them useful for solving problems in set theory and discrete mathematics.

```python
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Complement of A
complement_A = U - A
print("Complement of A:", complement_A)  # Output: {8, 5, 6, 7}

# De Morgan's Law: (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
left_side = U - (A | B)
right_side = (U - A) & (U - B)
print("De Morgan's Law holds:", left_side == right_side)  # Output: True
```

Slide 10: Performance and Time Complexity

Sets in Python are implemented using hash tables, providing O(1) average time complexity for add, remove, and lookup operations. This makes them efficient for handling large amounts of data.

```python
import timeit

def test_list_vs_set(n):
    # Create a list and a set with n elements
    lst = list(range(n))
    st = set(range(n))
    
    # Test lookup time for list
    list_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: n-1 in lst, number=1000)
    
    # Test lookup time for set
    set_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: n-1 in st, number=1000)
    
    print(f"List lookup time: {list_time:.6f} seconds")
    print(f"Set lookup time: {set_time:.6f} seconds")

test_list_vs_set(100000)
# Output:
# List lookup time: 0.003322 seconds
# Set lookup time: 0.000009 seconds
```

Slide 11: Real-life Example: Unique Word Counter

Sets can be used to efficiently count unique words in a text, which is useful in natural language processing and text analysis.

```python
def count_unique_words(text):
    # Convert text to lowercase and split into words
    words = text.lower().split()
    
    # Create a set of unique words
    unique_words = set(words)
    
    return len(unique_words)

sample_text = """
Python is a versatile programming language.
Python is widely used in data science, web development, and automation.
Python's simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.
"""

unique_word_count = count_unique_words(sample_text)
print(f"Number of unique words: {unique_word_count}")
# Output: Number of unique words: 20
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Finding Common Interests

Sets can be used to find common interests among users, which is useful in social networks and recommendation systems.

```python
def find_common_interests(user1_interests, user2_interests):
    # Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(user1_interests)
    set2 = set(user2_interests)
    
    # Find common interests
    common = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    return common

user1 = ["reading", "hiking", "photography", "cooking", "travel"]
user2 = ["travel", "photography", "music", "painting", "cooking"]

common_interests = find_common_interests(user1, user2)
print("Common interests:", common_interests)
# Output: Common interests: {'cooking', 'photography', 'travel'}
```

Slide 13: Set Operations with Multiple Sets

Python sets can be used to perform operations on multiple sets simultaneously, which is useful for complex data analysis and filtering.

```python
def multi_set_operations(sets):
    # Find elements common to all sets
    common = set.intersection(*sets)
    
    # Find elements present in any of the sets
    union = set.union(*sets)
    
    # Find elements unique to each set
    unique = [set(s) - set.union(*(sets[:i] + sets[i+1:]))
              for i, s in enumerate(sets)]
    
    return common, union, unique

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
set3 = {1, 3, 5, 7}

common, union, unique = multi_set_operations([set1, set2, set3])
print("Common elements:", common)
print("All elements:", union)
print("Unique elements:", unique)
# Output:
# Common elements: {3}
# All elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
# Unique elements: [{2, 4}, {6}, {7}]
```
