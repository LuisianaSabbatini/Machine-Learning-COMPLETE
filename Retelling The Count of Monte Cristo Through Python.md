## Retelling The Count of Monte Cristo Through Python
Slide 1: Introduction to "The Count of Monte Cristo"

This presentation explores Alexandre Dumas' classic novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" through the lens of Python programming. We'll examine key events and themes from the book, proposing innovative Python approaches to analyze and understand the story's complexities. Our journey will take us through optimization algorithms, cryptography, network analysis, and more, offering a fresh perspective on this timeless tale of betrayal and revenge.

Slide 2: Optimizing Edmond Dantès' Escape

Edmond Dantès, wrongfully imprisoned in the Château d'If, faces the challenge of escaping. We can use Python's optimization algorithms to determine the most efficient escape route, considering factors such as guard patrols, structural weaknesses, and time constraints.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

# Define the prison layout as a cost matrix
# 0 = free path, higher numbers = obstacles or risks
prison_layout = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 2, 1],
    [2, 0, 4, 3, 2],
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [3, 2, 1, 0, 5]
])

# Find the optimal path using the Hungarian algorithm
row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(prison_layout)

# Calculate the total cost of the escape route
total_cost = prison_layout[row_ind, col_ind].sum()

print(f"Optimal escape route cost: {total_cost}")
print("Escape route:")
for i, j in zip(row_ind, col_ind):
    print(f"Step {i+1}: Move to position ({i}, {j})")
```

Slide 3: Cryptographic Communication with Abbé Faria

During his imprisonment, Dantès meets Abbé Faria, who becomes his mentor. To communicate secretly, we can implement a simple substitution cipher using Python, allowing them to exchange messages without detection.

```python
def create_cipher(key):
    return {chr(i): key[i-97] for i in range(97, 123)}

def encrypt(message, cipher):
    return ''.join(cipher.get(c, c) for c in message.lower())

def decrypt(message, cipher):
    rev_cipher = {v: k for k, v in cipher.items()}
    return ''.join(rev_cipher.get(c, c) for c in message.lower())

# Abbé Faria's cipher key
key = "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
cipher = create_cipher(key)

# Encrypt a message
secret_message = "meet at midnight"
encrypted = encrypt(secret_message, cipher)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")

# Decrypt the message
decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, cipher)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

Slide 4: Network Analysis of Betrayal

Dantès' downfall is orchestrated by a network of conspirators. We can use Python's NetworkX library to visualize and analyze the relationships between the characters involved in his betrayal.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a graph of the betrayal network
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([
    ("Fernand Mondego", "Baron Danglars"),
    ("Baron Danglars", "Gérard de Villefort"),
    ("Gérard de Villefort", "Fernand Mondego"),
    ("Edmond Dantès", "Fernand Mondego"),
    ("Edmond Dantès", "Baron Danglars"),
    ("Edmond Dantès", "Gérard de Villefort")
])

# Calculate betweenness centrality
betweenness = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)

# Visualize the network
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=3000, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, {node: f"{node}\n{centrality:.2f}" for node, centrality in betweenness.items()})

plt.title("Betrayal Network in The Count of Monte Cristo")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

# Print the node with the highest betweenness centrality
key_player = max(betweenness, key=betweenness.get)
print(f"The key player in the betrayal network is: {key_player}")
```

Slide 5: Monte Carlo Simulation of Treasure Discovery

Dantès' fortune hinges on finding the treasure on the Isle of Monte Cristo. We can use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of discovering the treasure based on various factors such as search area, time, and resources.

```python
import random

def simulate_treasure_hunt(days, search_radius, treasure_location):
    for _ in range(days):
        x = random.uniform(-search_radius, search_radius)
        y = random.uniform(-search_radius, search_radius)
        if ((x - treasure_location[0])**2 + (y - treasure_location[1])**2)**0.5 <= 0.1:
            return True
    return False

# Simulation parameters
num_simulations = 10000
days_to_search = 30
search_radius = 5
treasure_location = (2.5, 3.7)

# Run simulations
successes = sum(simulate_treasure_hunt(days_to_search, search_radius, treasure_location) 
                for _ in range(num_simulations))

probability = successes / num_simulations
print(f"Probability of finding the treasure: {probability:.2%}")
```

Slide 6: Time Series Analysis of Dantès' Revenge

As the Count of Monte Cristo, Dantès meticulously plans his revenge over many years. We can use time series analysis to model the progression of his revenge plot and predict future actions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data for revenge actions over time
np.random.seed(42)
dates = pd.date_range(start='1838-01-01', end='1844-12-31', freq='M')
revenge_actions = np.cumsum(np.random.randint(0, 5, size=len(dates))) + np.random.normal(0, 5, size=len(dates))

# Create a time series
ts = pd.Series(revenge_actions, index=dates)

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(ts, order=(1, 1, 1))
results = model.fit()

# Forecast future actions
forecast = results.forecast(steps=12)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(ts.index, ts.values, label='Historical')
plt.plot(forecast.index, forecast.values, label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.title("Time Series Analysis of Dantès' Revenge Actions")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Revenge Actions")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

print("Forecasted revenge actions for the next year:")
print(forecast)
```

Slide 7: Natural Language Processing for Character Analysis

To gain deeper insights into the characters' motivations and development, we can apply natural language processing techniques to analyze their dialogue and narration throughout the novel.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from collections import Counter

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def analyze_character_speech(text, character_name):
    # Tokenize the text and remove stopwords
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]

    # Count word frequencies
    word_freq = Counter(filtered_tokens)

    # Get the most common words
    most_common = word_freq.most_common(10)

    print(f"Most common words in {character_name}'s speech:")
    for word, count in most_common:
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

    # Calculate lexical diversity
    lexical_diversity = len(set(filtered_tokens)) / len(filtered_tokens)
    print(f"Lexical diversity: {lexical_diversity:.2f}")

# Example usage (you would need the full text of the character's dialogue)
dantes_speech = """
I am Edmond Dantès, and I have come to seek vengeance upon those who wronged me.
The world is mine, for I possess the power that wealth brings, and the desire for revenge that drives me.
"""

analyze_character_speech(dantes_speech, "Edmond Dantès")
```

Slide 8: Markov Chain for Plot Generation

We can use a Markov Chain to generate alternative plot scenarios based on the events in the novel, exploring how different choices might have altered the course of the story.

```python
import random

def build_markov_chain(text):
    words = text.split()
    chain = {}
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        current = words[i]
        next_word = words[i + 1]
        if current not in chain:
            chain[current] = {}
        if next_word not in chain[current]:
            chain[current][next_word] = 0
        chain[current][next_word] += 1
    return chain

def generate_plot(chain, start_word, length=50):
    current = start_word
    result = [current]
    for _ in range(length - 1):
        if current not in chain:
            break
        possibilities = chain[current]
        next_word = random.choices(list(possibilities.keys()), 
                                   weights=list(possibilities.values()))[0]
        result.append(next_word)
        current = next_word
    return ' '.join(result)

# Example plot summary (you would use a more comprehensive summary in practice)
plot_summary = """
Edmond Dantès is betrayed and imprisoned. He escapes and finds treasure. 
Dantès becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and seeks revenge. He manipulates 
his enemies and ultimately achieves his vengeance.
"""

markov_chain = build_markov_chain(plot_summary)
alternative_plot = generate_plot(markov_chain, "Edmond")
print("Alternative plot scenario:")
print(alternative_plot)
```

Slide 9: Decision Tree for Character Choices

Throughout the novel, characters face critical decisions that shape the story. We can use a decision tree to model these choices and their potential outcomes.

```python
from sklearn import tree
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define features and outcomes
X = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1],  # Dantès: Trust friends, Don't escape, Seek revenge
    [0, 1, 0],  # Abbé Faria: Don't trust, Attempt escape, Don't seek revenge
    [1, 0, 0],  # Mercédès: Trust friends, Don't escape, Don't seek revenge
    [0, 0, 1]   # Fernand: Don't trust, Don't escape, Seek revenge
])
y = np.array(['Imprisoned', 'Dies in prison', 'Marries another', 'Exposed'])

# Create and fit the decision tree
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf = clf.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['Trust Friends', 'Attempt Escape', 'Seek Revenge'],
               class_names=clf.classes_, filled=True, rounded=True)
plt.title("Decision Tree for Character Choices")
plt.show()

# Predict outcome for a new scenario
new_scenario = np.array([[0, 1, 1]])  # Don't trust, Attempt escape, Seek revenge
prediction = clf.predict(new_scenario)
print(f"Predicted outcome for new scenario: {prediction[0]}")
```

Slide 10: Clustering Analysis of Locations

The Count of Monte Cristo spans various locations across Europe. We can use clustering analysis to group these locations based on their significance to the plot and characters.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define locations with their coordinates (latitude, longitude) and plot importance
locations = [
    ("Marseille", 43.2965, 5.3698, 8),
    ("Paris", 48.8566, 2.3522, 9),
    ("Rome", 41.9028, 12.4964, 6),
    ("Monte Cristo", 42.3806, 10.3139, 10),
    ("Château d'If", 43.2803, 5.3247, 7),
    ("Auteuil", 48.8565, 2.2582, 5),
    ("Janina", 39.6650, 20.8506, 4)
]

# Extract features for clustering
X = np.array([[loc[1], loc[2], loc[3]] for loc in locations])

# Perform K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Visualize the clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
scatter = plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, s=X[:, 2]*20, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(scatter)

for i, loc in enumerate(locations):
    plt.annotate(loc[0], (X[i, 0], X[i, 1]))

plt.title("Clustering of Locations in The Count of Monte Cristo")
plt.xlabel("Latitude")
plt.ylabel("Longitude")
plt.show()

# Print cluster assignments
for loc, label in zip(locations, kmeans.labels_):
    print(f"{loc[0]}: Cluster {label}")
```

Slide 11: Text Generation for Character Letters

The novel features numerous letters exchanged between characters. We can use a simple Markov chain-based text generation model to create plausible character correspondence.

```python
import random

def build_markov_model(text, n=2):
    words = text.split()
    model = {}
    for i in range(len(words) - n):
        state = tuple(words[i:i+n])
        next_word = words[i+n]
        if state not in model:
            model[state] = {}
        if next_word not in model[state]:
            model[state][next_word] = 0
        model[state][next_word] += 1
    return model

def generate_letter(model, num_words=50, n=2):
    current_state = random.choice(list(model.keys()))
    result = list(current_state)
    for _ in range(num_words - n):
        if current_state not in model:
            break
        next_word = random.choices(list(model[current_state].keys()),
                                   weights=list(model[current_state].values()))[0]
        result.append(next_word)
        current_state = tuple(result[-n:])
    return ' '.join(result)

# Example training text (you would use more extensive samples from the book)
sample_text = """
My dearest Mercédès, I write to you with a heavy heart, for the betrayal I have suffered 
weighs upon my soul. Yet, I assure you, my love for you remains unchanged. The Count of 
Monte Cristo may be a mystery to many, but to you, I shall always be Edmond Dantès.
"""

model = build_markov_model(sample_text)
generated_letter = generate_letter(model)

print("Generated character letter:")
print(generated_letter)
```
