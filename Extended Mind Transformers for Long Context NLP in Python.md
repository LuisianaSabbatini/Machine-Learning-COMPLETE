## Extended Mind Transformers for Long Context NLP in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Extended Mind Transformers

Extended Mind Transformers (EMT) are a novel approach to handling long-context tasks in natural language processing without the need for extensive fine-tuning. This technique allows models to process and understand much longer sequences of text efficiently.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

text = "Extended Mind Transformers can handle long contexts efficiently."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```

Slide 2: The Challenge of Long-Context Processing

Traditional transformer models struggle with long sequences due to quadratic attention complexity. EMT addresses this limitation by introducing a more efficient attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length.

```python
def quadratic_attention(seq_len):
    return seq_len ** 2

def linear_attention(seq_len):
    return seq_len

print(f"Quadratic attention for 1000 tokens: {quadratic_attention(1000)}")
print(f"Linear attention for 1000 tokens: {linear_attention(1000)}")
```

Slide 3: Key Components of Extended Mind Transformers

EMT incorporates three main components: external memory, sparse attention, and dynamic routing. These elements work together to enable efficient processing of long sequences without compromising performance.

```python
class ExtendedMindTransformer:
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads, memory_size):
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.memory_size = memory_size
        self.external_memory = torch.zeros(memory_size, hidden_size)
        
    def sparse_attention(self, query, key, value):
        # Implement sparse attention mechanism
        pass
    
    def dynamic_routing(self, input_tensor):
        # Implement dynamic routing
        pass
```

Slide 4: External Memory in EMT

External memory acts as a knowledge repository, allowing the model to store and retrieve information efficiently. This component helps in maintaining context over long sequences.

```python
class ExternalMemory:
    def __init__(self, memory_size, hidden_size):
        self.memory = torch.zeros(memory_size, hidden_size)
    
    def write(self, address, content):
        self.memory[address] = content
    
    def read(self, address):
        return self.memory[address]

memory = ExternalMemory(1000, 768)
memory.write(0, torch.rand(768))
retrieved_content = memory.read(0)
```

Slide 5: Sparse Attention Mechanism

Sparse attention reduces computational complexity by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence. This allows EMT to process longer contexts more efficiently.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

def sparse_attention(query, key, value, sparsity_factor=0.1):
    attention_scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    top_k = int(attention_scores.shape[-1] * sparsity_factor)
    
    values, indices = torch.topk(attention_scores, top_k, dim=-1)
    sparse_attention_scores = torch.zeros_like(attention_scores)
    sparse_attention_scores.scatter_(-1, indices, values)
    
    attention_probs = F.softmax(sparse_attention_scores, dim=-1)
    context = torch.matmul(attention_probs, value)
    
    return context
```

Slide 6: Dynamic Routing in EMT

Dynamic routing allows the model to adaptively select the most relevant information paths, enhancing its ability to handle complex and long-range dependencies.

```python
def dynamic_routing(input_tensor, num_iterations=3):
    batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size = input_tensor.shape
    routing_logits = torch.zeros(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
    
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        routing_weights = F.softmax(routing_logits, dim=-1)
        weighted_inputs = input_tensor * routing_weights
        
        # Update routing logits based on agreement
        agreement = torch.sum(weighted_inputs, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        routing_logits += agreement
    
    return weighted_inputs
```

Slide 7: Implementing EMT - Model Architecture

The EMT model architecture combines traditional transformer layers with the new components to create a powerful long-context processing system.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class EMTLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads, memory_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_size, num_heads)
        self.external_memory = ExternalMemory(memory_size, hidden_size)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size * 4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size * 4, hidden_size)
        )
        self.layer_norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
        self.layer_norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        attention_output = self.self_attention(x, x, x)[0]
        x = self.layer_norm1(x + attention_output)
        
        memory_output = self.external_memory.read(torch.arange(x.size(0)))
        x = x + memory_output
        
        ff_output = self.feed_forward(x)
        x = self.layer_norm2(x + ff_output)
        
        return x
```

Slide 8: Training an EMT Model

Training an EMT model involves adapting the loss function and optimization process to account for the new components and longer context windows.

```python
def train_emt_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            input_ids, attention_mask, labels = batch
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            loss = compute_loss(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Update external memory
            model.update_memory(input_ids, outputs)

def compute_loss(outputs, labels):
    # Implement your loss function here
    pass
```

Slide 9: Handling Long Sequences with EMT

EMT's ability to process long sequences enables it to tackle tasks that were previously challenging for transformer models, such as document summarization and long-form question answering.

```python
def process_long_document(model, tokenizer, document):
    max_length = model.config.max_position_embeddings
    chunks = [document[i:i+max_length] for i in range(0, len(document), max_length)]
    
    processed_chunks = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        inputs = tokenizer(chunk, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=max_length)
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        processed_chunks.append(outputs.last_hidden_state)
    
    return torch.cat(processed_chunks, dim=1)
```

Slide 10: EMT for Document Summarization

EMT's long-context capabilities make it particularly well-suited for tasks like document summarization, where understanding the entire context is crucial.

```python
def summarize_document(model, tokenizer, document):
    processed_document = process_long_document(model, tokenizer, document)
    summary_tokens = model.generate(
        inputs=processed_document,
        max_length=150,
        num_beams=4,
        length_penalty=2.0,
        early_stopping=True
    )
    summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return summary
```

Slide 11: EMT for Long-Form Question Answering

EMT can handle long-form question answering by efficiently processing extensive context and generating detailed answers.

```python
def long_form_qa(model, tokenizer, context, question):
    inputs = tokenizer(context, question, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=4096)
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_length=500,
        num_beams=4,
        length_penalty=2.0,
        early_stopping=True
    )
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return answer
```

Slide 12: EMT for Code Understanding and Generation

EMT's ability to handle long contexts makes it suitable for tasks involving code understanding and generation, where maintaining context across multiple functions or files is important.

```python
def analyze_code(model, tokenizer, code):
    inputs = tokenizer(code, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=4096)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    
    # Extract relevant features for code analysis
    code_representation = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
    
    # Perform further analysis or classification based on the code representation
    # For example, detect coding style, identify potential bugs, or suggest optimizations
    analysis_results = perform_code_analysis(code_representation)
    
    return analysis_results

def perform_code_analysis(code_representation):
    # Implement your code analysis logic here
    pass
```

Slide 13: Future Directions and Potential Improvements

As EMT continues to evolve, researchers are exploring ways to further enhance its performance, such as incorporating hierarchical attention mechanisms and developing more efficient memory management techniques.

```python
class HierarchicalEMT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads, num_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.local_attention_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EMTLayer(hidden_size, num_heads, memory_size=1000)
            for _ in range(num_layers // 2)
        ])
        self.global_attention_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EMTLayer(hidden_size, num_heads, memory_size=5000)
            for _ in range(num_layers // 2)
        ])
    
    def forward(self, x):
        for local_layer, global_layer in zip(self.local_attention_layers, self.global_attention_layers):
            x = local_layer(x)
            x = global_layer(x)
        return x
```
