## Magic Squares of Powers in Python
Slide 1: Magic Squares of Powers: A Python Exploration

Magic squares have fascinated mathematicians for centuries. In this presentation, we'll explore a unique variant: magic squares of powers. We'll use Python to generate and analyze these intriguing mathematical structures, demonstrating how programming can be a powerful tool in mathematical exploration.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_magic_square(square):
    n = len(square)
    target_sum = sum(square[0])
    
    # Check rows and columns
    for i in range(n):
        if sum(square[i]) != target_sum or sum(square[:, i]) != target_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check diagonals
    if sum(np.diag(square)) != target_sum or sum(np.diag(np.fliplr(square))) != target_sum:
        return False
    
    return True

# Example usage
square = np.array([[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]])
print(f"Is it a magic square? {is_magic_square(square)}")
```

Slide 2: Understanding Magic Squares of Powers

A magic square of powers is a square array of numbers where each row, column, and diagonal sum to the same value, and each number is a power of a specific base. For example, in a magic square of powers of 2, each number would be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).

```python
def generate_powers(base, n):
    return [base ** i for i in range(n**2)]

def create_magic_square_of_powers(base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    square = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)
    # ... (implementation of magic square algorithm)
    return square

# Example: 3x3 magic square of powers of 2
result = create_magic_square_of_powers(2, 3)
print(result)
```

Slide 3: Generating Magic Squares of Powers

To create a magic square of powers, we first generate the necessary powers of our chosen base. Then, we arrange these powers in a square following a specific algorithm. One common method is the Siamese method, which works for odd-sized squares.

```python
def siamese_method(n, powers):
    square = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)
    i, j = 0, n // 2
    for k in range(n**2):
        square[i, j] = powers[k]
        i, j = (i - 1) % n, (j + 1) % n
        if square[i, j] != 0:
            i, j = (i + 2) % n, (j - 1) % n
    return square

base, n = 2, 3
powers = generate_powers(base, n)
result = siamese_method(n, powers)
print(result)
```

Slide 4: Verifying Magic Squares of Powers

Once we've generated a magic square of powers, we need to verify its properties. We'll check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value, and if all numbers are powers of our chosen base.

```python
def verify_magic_square_of_powers(square, base):
    n = len(square)
    target_sum = sum(square[0])
    
    # Check if all numbers are powers of the base
    all_powers = all(np.log(num) / np.log(base) % 1 == 0 for row in square for num in row)
    
    # Check sums
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in square]
    col_sums = [sum(square[:, i]) for i in range(n)]
    diag_sums = [sum(np.diag(square)), sum(np.diag(np.fliplr(square)))]
    
    return all_powers and all(sum == target_sum for sum in row_sums + col_sums + diag_sums)

# Verify our previously generated square
print(f"Is it a valid magic square of powers? {verify_magic_square_of_powers(result, 2)}")
```

Slide 5: Exploring Different Bases

Magic squares of powers can be created using different bases. Let's explore how changing the base affects the resulting square. We'll generate magic squares of powers for bases 2, 3, and 5.

```python
def explore_bases(bases, n):
    for base in bases:
        powers = generate_powers(base, n)
        square = siamese_method(n, powers)
        print(f"Magic square of powers of {base}:")
        print(square)
        print(f"Valid: {verify_magic_square_of_powers(square, base)}\n")

explore_bases([2, 3, 5], 3)
```

Slide 6: Analyzing Magic Constant

The magic constant is the sum of each row, column, and diagonal in a magic square. For a magic square of powers, this constant has interesting properties related to the base and size of the square.

```python
def analyze_magic_constant(base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    square = siamese_method(n, powers)
    magic_constant = sum(square[0])
    
    print(f"Base: {base}, Size: {n}x{n}")
    print(f"Magic Constant: {magic_constant}")
    print(f"Sum of all powers: {sum(powers)}")
    print(f"Ratio (Magic Constant / Sum of Powers): {magic_constant / sum(powers):.4f}")

analyze_magic_constant(2, 3)
analyze_magic_constant(2, 5)
```

Slide 7: Visualizing Magic Squares of Powers

Visualization can help us understand the patterns in magic squares of powers. Let's create a heatmap representation of a magic square of powers using matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_magic_square(square):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.imshow(square, cmap='YlOrRd')
    for i in range(len(square)):
        for j in range(len(square)):
            plt.text(j, i, str(square[i, j]), ha='center', va='center')
    plt.title("Magic Square of Powers Heatmap")
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

base, n = 2, 5
powers = generate_powers(base, n)
square = siamese_method(n, powers)
visualize_magic_square(square)
```

Slide 8: Patterns in Magic Squares of Powers

Magic squares of powers often exhibit interesting patterns. Let's explore these patterns by generating larger squares and analyzing the distribution of powers within them.

```python
def analyze_patterns(base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    square = siamese_method(n, powers)
    
    power_counts = {p: np.sum(square == p) for p in powers}
    sorted_counts = sorted(power_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    print(f"Power distribution in {n}x{n} magic square of powers of {base}:")
    for power, count in sorted_counts:
        print(f"{power}: {count} occurrences")

analyze_patterns(2, 7)
```

Slide 9: Generalizing to Higher Dimensions

The concept of magic squares can be extended to higher dimensions, creating magic cubes or hypercubes of powers. Let's implement a function to generate a 3D magic cube of powers.

```python
def generate_magic_cube_of_powers(base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n**3)
    cube = np.zeros((n, n, n), dtype=int)
    
    i, j, k = n//2, n//2, 0
    for p in range(n**3):
        cube[i, j, k] = powers[p]
        i = (i - 1) % n
        j = (j + 1) % n
        k = (k + 1) % n
        if cube[i, j, k] != 0:
            i = (i + 1) % n
            j = (j - 1) % n
            k = (k - 1) % n
            i = (i + 1) % n
    
    return cube

magic_cube = generate_magic_cube_of_powers(2, 3)
print("3D Magic Cube of Powers:")
print(magic_cube)
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Cryptographic Puzzles

Magic squares of powers can be used in cryptographic puzzles. For example, a secret message could be encoded by mapping letters to specific powers in a magic square. The recipient would need to reconstruct the magic square to decode the message.

```python
def encode_message(message, base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    square = siamese_method(n, powers)
    encoding = {chr(65+i): p for i, p in enumerate(powers)}
    return ''.join(str(encoding.get(c.upper(), '?')) for c in message)

def decode_message(encoded, base, n):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    square = siamese_method(n, powers)
    decoding = {str(p): chr(65+i) for i, p in enumerate(powers)}
    return ''.join(decoding.get(c, '?') for c in encoded.split())

message = "HELLO WORLD"
encoded = encode_message(message, 2, 4)
decoded = decode_message(encoded, 2, 4)
print(f"Original: {message}")
print(f"Encoded: {encoded}")
print(f"Decoded: {decoded}")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Game Design

Magic squares of powers can be incorporated into puzzle games. Players might be challenged to complete a partially filled magic square of powers, promoting logical thinking and pattern recognition.

```python
def create_puzzle(base, n, num_hints):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    solution = siamese_method(n, powers)
    puzzle = np.zeros_like(solution)
    
    hints = np.random.choice(n*n, num_hints, replace=False)
    for hint in hints:
        i, j = hint // n, hint % n
        puzzle[i, j] = solution[i, j]
    
    return puzzle, solution

puzzle, solution = create_puzzle(2, 4, 5)
print("Puzzle:")
print(puzzle)
print("\nSolution:")
print(solution)
```

Slide 12: Optimizing Magic Square Generation

As we work with larger magic squares of powers, efficiency becomes crucial. Let's implement an optimized version of our magic square generation algorithm using NumPy's vectorized operations.

```python
def optimized_siamese_method(n, powers):
    square = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)
    indices = np.arange(n**2)
    i = n - (indices + 1) % n - 1
    j = (indices + n // 2) % n
    square[i, j] = powers
    return square

def benchmark(n, base):
    powers = generate_powers(base, n)
    
    import time
    start = time.time()
    original = siamese_method(n, powers)
    original_time = time.time() - start
    
    start = time.time()
    optimized = optimized_siamese_method(n, powers)
    optimized_time = time.time() - start
    
    print(f"Original method: {original_time:.6f} seconds")
    print(f"Optimized method: {optimized_time:.6f} seconds")
    print(f"Speedup: {original_time / optimized_time:.2f}x")

benchmark(101, 2)
```

Slide 13: Exploring Properties of Magic Squares of Powers

Let's investigate some interesting properties of magic squares of powers, such as the relationship between the magic constant and the sum of all elements in the square.

```python
def analyze_properties(base, sizes):
    for n in sizes:
        powers = generate_powers(base, n)
        square = optimized_siamese_method(n, powers)
        magic_constant = sum(square[0])
        total_sum = np.sum(square)
        
        print(f"Size: {n}x{n}, Base: {base}")
        print(f"Magic Constant: {magic_constant}")
        print(f"Total Sum: {total_sum}")
        print(f"Ratio (Magic Constant / Total Sum): {magic_constant / total_sum:.4f}")
        print()

analyze_properties(2, [3, 5, 7, 9])
```
