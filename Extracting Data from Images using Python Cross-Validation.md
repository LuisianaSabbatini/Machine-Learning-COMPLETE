##  Extracting Data from Images using Python Cross-Validation
Slide 1: Introduction to Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a crucial technique in machine learning for assessing model performance and preventing overfitting. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets, and validating it on others. This process helps evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Create a model
model = LinearRegression()

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 2: The Need for Cross-Validation

Cross-validation addresses the limitations of using a single train-test split. It provides a more robust estimate of model performance by using multiple train-test combinations. This approach helps detect overfitting and gives a better indication of how the model will perform on new, unseen data.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Single train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
single_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Single split score: {single_score:.2f}")
print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {cv_scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 3: K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold cross-validation is a common technique where the dataset is divided into K equal-sized folds. The model is trained on K-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated K times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The final performance metric is the average of all K iterations.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10])

# Create KFold object
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Perform K-Fold CV
model = LinearRegression()
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in kf.split(X):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))

print(f"K-Fold CV scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 4: Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

Stratified K-Fold CV is a variation of K-Fold CV that maintains the same proportion of samples for each class in the training and validation splits. This method is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets or when dealing with classification problems.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create StratifiedKFold object
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Perform Stratified K-Fold CV
model = SVC(kernel='linear')
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in skf.split(X, y):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))

print(f"Stratified K-Fold CV scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

LOOCV is an extreme form of K-Fold CV where K equals the number of samples in the dataset. In each iteration, one sample is used for validation, and the rest for training. This method provides an nearly unbiased estimate of model performance but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneOut
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Create LeaveOneOut object
loo = LeaveOneOut()

# Perform LOOCV
model = LinearRegression()
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in loo.split(X):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))

print(f"LOOCV scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 6: Time Series Cross-Validation

Time series data requires special consideration in cross-validation to maintain the temporal order of observations. Time series cross-validation uses a rolling window approach, where each validation set is always ahead in time compared to its corresponding training set.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate sample time series data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.array(range(100)).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.sin(X/10) + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Create TimeSeriesSplit object
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Perform Time Series CV
model = LinearRegression()
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in tscv.split(X):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))

print(f"Time Series CV scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 7: Cross-Validation with Hyperparameter Tuning

Cross-validation can be combined with hyperparameter tuning to find the best model configuration. This process involves nested cross-validation, where an inner loop selects the best hyperparameters, and an outer loop evaluates the model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Create GridSearchCV object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, cv=5)

# Perform nested cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(grid_search, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Nested CV scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 8: Cross-Validation Metrics

Cross-validation can use various metrics to evaluate model performance. Common metrics include accuracy for classification and mean squared error (MSE) for regression. The choice of metric depends on the problem and the specific goals of the analysis.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
import numpy as np

# Load diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X, y = diabetes.data, diabetes.target

# Create model
model = LinearRegression()

# Perform cross-validation with different metrics
mse_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
r2_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2')

print(f"MSE scores: {-mse_scores}")  # Negate to get positive MSE
print(f"Mean MSE: {-mse_scores.mean():.2f}")
print(f"R2 scores: {r2_scores}")
print(f"Mean R2: {r2_scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 9: Cross-Validation for Feature Selection

Cross-validation can be used in feature selection to identify the most important features for predicting the target variable. This process helps reduce overfitting and improves model interpretability.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Load breast cancer dataset
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
X, y = cancer.data, cancer.target

# Create RFECV object
selector = RFECV(LogisticRegression(), step=1, cv=5)

# Perform feature selection
selector = selector.fit(X, y)

print(f"Optimal number of features: {selector.n_features_}")
print(f"Feature ranking: {selector.ranking_}")
```

Slide 10: Cross-Validation for Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting use cross-validation internally to improve their performance. This internal cross-validation is different from the external cross-validation used to evaluate the overall model.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, oob_score=True)

# Fit the model and get OOB score
rf_model.fit(X, y)
oob_score = rf_model.oob_score_

# Perform external cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"OOB Score: {oob_score:.2f}")
print(f"CV Scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV Score: {cv_scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Cross-Validation for Imbalanced Datasets

When dealing with imbalanced datasets, standard cross-validation might not provide reliable estimates of model performance. Techniques like stratified sampling or using specialized metrics can help address this issue.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)

# Create pipeline with SMOTE and Logistic Regression
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1')

print(f"F1 scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean F1 score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Cross-Validation for Time Series Forecasting

In time series forecasting, traditional cross-validation methods may lead to data leakage. Instead, we use techniques like expanding window or sliding window cross-validation to maintain the temporal order of observations.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Generate sample time series data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100))

# Create TimeSeriesSplit object
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Perform Time Series CV for ARIMA model
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in tscv.split(data):
    train, val = data[train_index], data[val_index]
    
    model = ARIMA(train, order=(1,1,1))
    model_fit = model.fit()
    
    forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=len(val))
    mse = mean_squared_error(val, forecast)
    scores.append(mse)

print(f"MSE scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean MSE: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 13: Cross-Validation in Deep Learning

Cross-validation in deep learning often involves using a validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Here's an example using TensorFlow and Keras to perform k-fold cross-validation on a simple neural network.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Define model architecture
def create_model():
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
        Dense(3, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Perform k-fold cross-validation
kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = []

for train_index, val_index in kfold.split(X, y):
    X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
    
    model = create_model()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
    
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val, verbose=0)
    scores.append(accuracy)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```
