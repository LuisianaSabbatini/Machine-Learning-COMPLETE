## Advanced Functional Programming in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Advanced Functional Programming in Python

Functional Programming (FP) in Python empowers developers to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. This paradigm focuses on using functions to solve problems and manipulate data, promoting immutability and avoiding side effects. By embracing FP concepts, Python programmers can create more robust and scalable applications.

Slide 2: Map Function: Transforming Data Efficiently

The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable, returning a map object that can be converted to a list or other sequence types. This powerful tool allows for concise and efficient data transformation.

Slide 3: Source Code for Map Function: Transforming Data Efficiently

```python
# Example: Converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
celsius_temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
fahrenheit_temps = list(map(lambda c: (c * 9/5) + 32, celsius_temps))
print(f"Celsius: {celsius_temps}")
print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahrenheit_temps}")

# Output:
# Celsius: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
# Fahrenheit: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]
```

Slide 4: Filter Function: Sifting Through Data

The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True. This allows for efficient data cleaning and selection based on specific criteria.

Slide 5: Source Code for Filter Function: Sifting Through Data

```python
# Example: Filtering even numbers from a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(f"Original numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Even numbers: {even_numbers}")

# Output:
# Original numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Slide 6: Reduce Function: Condensing Data to a Single Value

The reduce() function from the functools module applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, reducing it to a single value. This is particularly useful for aggregating results across datasets.

Slide 7: Source Code for Reduce Function: Condensing Data to a Single Value

```python
from functools import reduce

# Example: Calculating the product of all numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(f"Numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Product: {product}")

# Output:
# Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Product: 120
```

Slide 8: Lambda Functions: Anonymous Function Definitions

Lambda functions in Python are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are commonly used with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().

Slide 9: Source Code for Lambda Functions: Anonymous Function Definitions

```python
# Example: Using lambda functions with sorting
pairs = [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two'), (4, 'four')]
sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda pair: pair[1])
print(f"Original pairs: {pairs}")
print(f"Sorted pairs: {sorted_pairs}")

# Output:
# Original pairs: [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two'), (4, 'four')]
# Sorted pairs: [(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

Slide 10: List Comprehensions: Concise Iteration and Filtering

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or iterables. They combine the functionality of map() and filter() into a single, readable expression.

Slide 11: Source Code for List Comprehensions: Concise Iteration and Filtering

```python
# Example: Creating a list of squares for even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(f"Original numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Squares of even numbers: {even_squares}")

# Output:
# Original numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Squares of even numbers: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Text Processing

In this example, we'll use functional programming concepts to process a list of sentences, counting the occurrences of each word while ignoring common words.

Slide 13: Source Code for Real-Life Example: Text Processing

```python
from functools import reduce

sentences = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step",
    "To be or not to be that is the question"
]

common_words = set(['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'for', 'of', 'with', 'is'])

# Split sentences into words, convert to lowercase, and remove common words
words = [word.lower() for sentence in sentences for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() not in common_words]

# Count word occurrences using reduce and a dictionary
word_counts = reduce(lambda counts, word: {**counts, word: counts.get(word, 0) + 1}, words, {})

# Sort words by count (descending) and alphabetically
sorted_words = sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

print("Word counts (excluding common words):")
for word, count in sorted_words:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")

# Output:
# Word counts (excluding common words):
# be: 2
# quick: 1
# brown: 1
# fox: 1
# jumps: 1
# over: 1
# lazy: 1
# dog: 1
# journey: 1
# thousand: 1
# miles: 1
# begins: 1
# single: 1
# step: 1
# not: 1
# that: 1
# question: 1
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Data Analysis

In this example, we'll use functional programming techniques to analyze a dataset of student grades, calculating average scores and identifying top performers.

Slide 15: Source Code for Real-Life Example: Data Analysis

```python
from functools import reduce

students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grades": [85, 90, 92, 88]},
    {"name": "Bob", "grades": [78, 85, 80, 88]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grades": [92, 95, 89, 94]},
    {"name": "David", "grades": [86, 88, 90, 85]},
    {"name": "Eve", "grades": [90, 92, 94, 88]}
]

# Calculate average grade for each student
def calculate_average(grades):
    return round(sum(grades) / len(grades), 2)

students_with_averages = list(map(lambda s: {**s, "average": calculate_average(s["grades"])}, students))

# Find top performers (average grade >= 90)
top_performers = list(filter(lambda s: s["average"] >= 90, students_with_averages))

# Calculate overall class average
class_average = round(reduce(lambda acc, s: acc + s["average"], students_with_averages, 0) / len(students_with_averages), 2)

print("Student Averages:")
for student in students_with_averages:
    print(f"{student['name']}: {student['average']}")

print("\nTop Performers:")
for student in top_performers:
    print(f"{student['name']}: {student['average']}")

print(f"\nClass Average: {class_average}")

# Output:
# Student Averages:
# Alice: 88.75
# Bob: 82.75
# Charlie: 92.5
# David: 87.25
# Eve: 91.0

# Top Performers:
# Charlie: 92.5
# Eve: 91.0

# Class Average: 88.45
```
