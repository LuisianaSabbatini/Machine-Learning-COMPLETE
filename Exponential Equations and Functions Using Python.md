## Exponential Equations and Functions Using Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Exponential Equations

Exponential equations involve variables in the exponent. They are crucial in modeling growth and decay processes in various fields like finance, biology, and physics.

```python
# Basic form of an exponential equation
a**x = b

# Example: Solve 2**x = 8
import math

x = math.log(8, 2)
print(f"Solution: x = {x}")
```

Slide 2: Properties of Exponential Functions

Exponential functions have the form f(x) = a^x, where a > 0 and a ≠ 1. They are always positive and either increase or decrease rapidly, depending on the base.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
y1 = 2**x
y2 = 0.5**x

plt.plot(x, y1, label='2^x')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='0.5^x')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Exponential Functions')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Common Exponential Functions

The most common exponential function is e^x, where e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828). This function is particularly important in calculus and natural sciences.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
y = np.exp(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('e^x Function')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Solving Basic Exponential Equations

To solve basic exponential equations, we can often use logarithms. The equation a^x = b can be solved by taking the logarithm of both sides.

```python
import math

# Solve 3^x = 27
x = math.log(27, 3)
print(f"3^x = 27 is solved when x = {x}")

# Solve e^x = 10
x = math.log(10)  # math.log() uses base e by default
print(f"e^x = 10 is solved when x = {x:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Graphing Exponential Functions

Graphing exponential functions helps visualize their behavior. Key features include the y-intercept (always 1 when x = 0) and asymptotic behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-2, 4, 200)
y1 = 2**x
y2 = 3**x
y3 = 0.5**x

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y1, label='2^x')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='3^x')
plt.plot(x, y3, label='0.5^x')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Exponential Function Graphs')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Exponential Growth

Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases by a fixed percentage over time. It's common in population dynamics and compound interest calculations.

```python
def exponential_growth(initial, rate, time):
    return initial * (1 + rate)**time

initial_population = 1000
growth_rate = 0.05  # 5% annual growth
years = 10

final_population = exponential_growth(initial_population, growth_rate, years)
print(f"Population after {years} years: {final_population:.0f}")
```

Slide 7: Exponential Decay

Exponential decay describes quantities that decrease by a fixed percentage over time. It's observed in radioactive decay and depreciation of assets.

```python
def exponential_decay(initial, rate, time):
    return initial * (1 - rate)**time

initial_amount = 1000
decay_rate = 0.1  # 10% annual decay
years = 5

final_amount = exponential_decay(initial_amount, decay_rate, years)
print(f"Amount after {years} years: {final_amount:.2f}")
```

Slide 8: Compound Interest

Compound interest is a practical application of exponential growth in finance. It calculates the growth of investments over time.

```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year):
    return principal * (1 + rate/compounds_per_year)**(compounds_per_year * time)

principal = 1000
annual_rate = 0.05
years = 10
compounds = 12  # monthly compounding

result = compound_interest(principal, annual_rate, years, compounds)
print(f"Investment value after {years} years: ${result:.2f}")
```

Slide 9: Logarithmic Functions

Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions. They're crucial for solving exponential equations and modeling certain natural phenomena.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 100)
y1 = np.log(x)  # natural log
y2 = np.log10(x)  # base 10 log

plt.plot(x, y1, label='ln(x)')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='log10(x)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Logarithmic Functions')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Solving Complex Exponential Equations

More complex exponential equations may require advanced techniques like substitution or the use of Lambert W function.

```python
from scipy.special import lambertw
import numpy as np

# Solve x * e^x = 10
x = lambertw(10).real
print(f"Solution to x * e^x = 10: x = {x:.4f}")

# Verify
result = x * np.exp(x)
print(f"Verification: {x:.4f} * e^{x:.4f} = {result:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Exponential Regression

Exponential regression fits an exponential function to a set of data points. It's useful for analyzing data that exhibits exponential growth or decay.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([1.0, 2.1, 4.3, 8.7, 17.8, 35.9])

# Define exponential function
def exp_func(x, a, b):
    return a * np.exp(b * x)

# Fit the data
popt, _ = curve_fit(exp_func, x, y)
a, b = popt

# Plot results
plt.scatter(x, y, label='Data')
plt.plot(x, exp_func(x, a, b), 'r-', label=f'{a:.2f}*exp({b:.2f}x)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Exponential Regression')
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Newton's Law of Cooling

Newton's Law of Cooling is an application of exponential decay in physics. It describes how an object cools to the ambient temperature.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def cooling_model(t, initial_temp, ambient_temp, k):
    return ambient_temp + (initial_temp - ambient_temp) * np.exp(-k * t)

t = np.linspace(0, 60, 100)
initial_temp = 100
ambient_temp = 25
k = 0.05

temp = cooling_model(t, initial_temp, ambient_temp, k)

plt.plot(t, temp)
plt.title("Newton's Law of Cooling")
plt.xlabel("Time (minutes)")
plt.ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson point process. It's related to exponential decay.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def exponential_pdf(x, lambda_param):
    return lambda_param * np.exp(-lambda_param * x)

x = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)
lambda_param = 1

y = exponential_pdf(x, lambda_param)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Exponential Distribution PDF')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 14: Half-Life Calculations

Half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. It's commonly used in nuclear physics and pharmacokinetics.

```python
import math

def calculate_half_life(initial_amount, final_amount, time):
    decay_constant = -math.log(final_amount / initial_amount) / time
    half_life = math.log(2) / decay_constant
    return half_life

initial = 1000
final = 500
time = 5  # years

half_life = calculate_half_life(initial, final, time)
print(f"Half-life: {half_life:.2f} years")
```
