## Introduction to Python Automation

Slide 1: 
Introduction to Python Automation

Python is a versatile programming language that can automate a wide range of tasks, from file operations to web scraping and even desktop automation. By leveraging Python's extensive libraries and tools, you can streamline repetitive processes, saving time and increasing efficiency.

Slide 2: 
File Operations

Python provides built-in modules for working with files, allowing you to read, write, copy, rename, and delete files with ease. This can be extremely useful for automating tasks involving file management, data processing, and bulk file operations.

Code Example:

```python
# Opening and reading a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a new file.")
```

Slide 3: 
Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Python's libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy make it easy to scrape data from websites, which can be useful for tasks like price monitoring, data analysis, and web content extraction.

Code Example:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Extract data from the webpage
data = soup.find("div", {"class": "data-container"}).text
print(data)
```

Slide 4: 
Automating Email

Python's built-in `smtplib` module allows you to send emails programmatically, which can be useful for automating email notifications, reports, or reminders. You can also use third-party libraries like `yagmail` for a more user-friendly email automation experience.

Code Example:

```python
import smtplib

sender = "your_email@example.com"
receiver = "recipient@example.com"
subject = "Automated Email"
body = "This is an automated email sent using Python."

message = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{body}"

with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as smtp:
    smtp.starttls()
    smtp.login("your_email@example.com", "your_password")
    smtp.sendmail(sender, receiver, message)
```

Slide 5: 
Desktop Automation

Python's PyAutoGUI library allows you to control the mouse, keyboard, and screen programmatically, enabling you to automate tasks on your desktop or within applications. This can be particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, testing user interfaces, or creating automated scripts.

Code Example:

```python
import pyautogui

# Move the mouse cursor to the specified coordinates
pyautogui.moveTo(500, 300)

# Click the left mouse button
pyautogui.click()

# Type a string of text
pyautogui.typewrite("Hello, World!")
```

Slide 6: 
Task Scheduling

Python's built-in `sched` and `schedule` modules, along with third-party libraries like `APScheduler`, allow you to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals. This can be useful for automating periodic tasks, such as data backups, system maintenance, or report generation.

Code Example:

```python
import schedule
import time

def job():
    print("This task runs every minute.")

schedule.every().minute.do(job)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

Slide 7: 
Data Processing

Python's data processing capabilities are vast, thanks to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. You can automate tasks like data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization, making it easier to work with large datasets and extract valuable insights.

Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Filter data based on a condition
filtered_data = data[data["Age"] > 30]

# Calculate summary statistics
mean_age = filtered_data["Age"].mean()
print(f"Mean age: {mean_age}")
```

Slide 8: 
API Automation

Python's libraries like `requests` and `urllib` make it easy to interact with APIs, allowing you to automate tasks that involve retrieving, processing, or sending data to web services or applications. This can be useful for tasks like data synchronization, integrating with third-party services, or building automated workflows.

Code Example:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

Slide 9: 
Automating System Administration Tasks

Python can be used to automate various system administration tasks, such as managing user accounts, monitoring system resources, and automating backups. Libraries like `subprocess` and `os` provide access to system commands and file operations, making it easier to automate these tasks programmatically.

Code Example:

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new user
subprocess.run(["useradd", "-m", "newuser"])

# Check disk usage
disk_usage = subprocess.check_output(["df", "-h"])
print(disk_usage.decode())
```

Slide 10: 
Automating Data Entry

Python can be used to automate data entry tasks, such as filling out web forms or entering data into applications. This can be achieved using libraries like `Selenium` for web automation or `pywinauto` for desktop application automation.

Code Example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Launch a web browser
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.example.com/form")

# Fill out a form
name_field = driver.find_element_by_id("name")
name_field.send_keys("John Doe")

submit_button = driver.find_element_by_id("submit")
submit_button.click()
```

Slide 11: 
Automating Image and Video Processing

Python provides powerful libraries like `OpenCV` and `Pillow` for image and video processing tasks. You can automate tasks like resizing, compressing, or applying filters to images, as well as extracting frames from videos or performing video analysis.

Code Example:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an image
image = Image.open("image.jpg")

# Resize the image
resized_image = image.resize((800, 600))

# Save the resized image
resized_image.save("resized_image.jpg")
```

Slide 12: 
Building Automation Scripts

Python's simplicity and versatility make it an excellent choice for building automation scripts. You can combine various automation techniques, such as file operations, web scraping, and task scheduling, to create powerful and customized automation solutions tailored to your specific needs.

Code Example:

```python
import os
import schedule
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def scrape_data():
    url = "https://www.example.com"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    data = soup.find("div", {"class": "data-container"}).text
    with open("data.txt", "a") as file:
        file.write(data + "\n")

schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(scrape_data)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```
