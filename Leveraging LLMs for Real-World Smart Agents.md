## Leveraging LLMs for Real-World Smart Agents
Slide 1: Agent-Based Parallel Processing

Agent-based parallel processing in LLMs involves distributing tasks among multiple agents to work simultaneously. This approach significantly reduces overall processing time and enhances efficiency.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def agent_task(task_id):
    print(f"Agent {task_id} starting work")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating work
    return f"Task {task_id} completed"

tasks = range(5)

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(agent_task, tasks))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

Slide 2: Speed and Cost Optimization

Optimizing speed and cost in LLM-based systems involves using faster, more cost-effective models for specific tasks. This strategy maintains efficiency while managing resource allocation.

```python
import time

class FastModel:
    def process(self, task):
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulating quick processing
        return f"Fast result: {task}"

class SlowModel:
    def process(self, task):
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulating slower, more complex processing
        return f"Detailed result: {task}"

def optimize_processing(task, complexity):
    if complexity == "low":
        model = FastModel()
    else:
        model = SlowModel()
    return model.process(task)

print(optimize_processing("Simple task", "low"))
print(optimize_processing("Complex analysis", "high"))
```

Slide 3: Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems in LLMs involve a main agent coordinating specialized agents, similar to a project manager overseeing experts in various fields.

```python
class MainAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.specialized_agents = {
            "healthcare": HealthcareAgent(),
            "legal": LegalAgent(),
            "tech": TechAgent()
        }

    def process_task(self, task, domain):
        if domain in self.specialized_agents:
            return self.specialized_agents[domain].process(task)
        else:
            return "No specialized agent available for this domain"

class HealthcareAgent:
    def process(self, task):
        return f"Healthcare analysis: {task}"

class LegalAgent:
    def process(self, task):
        return f"Legal interpretation: {task}"

class TechAgent:
    def process(self, task):
        return f"Technical solution: {task}"

main_agent = MainAgent()
print(main_agent.process_task("Analyze patient data", "healthcare"))
print(main_agent.process_task("Review contract", "legal"))
```

Slide 4: Enhanced Decision-Making

Enhancing decision-making in LLM systems involves leveraging agents with diverse perspectives to arrive at more comprehensive and balanced decisions.

```python
import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, bias):
        self.bias = bias

    def decide(self, problem):
        return random.random() < self.bias

def collective_decision(agents, problem, threshold=0.6):
    votes = sum(agent.decide(problem) for agent in agents)
    return votes / len(agents) >= threshold

agents = [Agent(0.3), Agent(0.5), Agent(0.7), Agent(0.6), Agent(0.4)]
problem = "Should we implement a new feature?"

decisions = [collective_decision(agents, problem) for _ in range(1000)]
agreement_rate = sum(decisions) / len(decisions)

print(f"Agreement rate: {agreement_rate:.2%}")
```

Slide 5: Specific Agent Specialization

Training agents for specific tools or tasks enhances their effectiveness, especially for complex jobs requiring deep expertise.

```python
class SpecializedAgent:
    def __init__(self, tool):
        self.tool = tool
        self.expertise = self.train()

    def train(self):
        if self.tool == "data_analysis":
            return 0.9  # 90% proficiency
        elif self.tool == "natural_language_processing":
            return 0.85  # 85% proficiency
        else:
            return 0.5  # 50% proficiency for unknown tools

    def perform_task(self, task):
        success_rate = self.expertise * random.random()
        return success_rate > 0.6  # Task is successful if rate > 60%

data_analyst = SpecializedAgent("data_analysis")
nlp_expert = SpecializedAgent("natural_language_processing")

print(f"Data analysis task success: {data_analyst.perform_task('Analyze customer data')}")
print(f"NLP task success: {nlp_expert.perform_task('Sentiment analysis of tweets')}")
```

Slide 6: Real-Life Example: Customer Support System

Implementing LLM-based agents in a customer support system to handle inquiries efficiently and accurately.

```python
class CustomerSupportSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            "general": GeneralAgent(),
            "technical": TechnicalAgent(),
            "billing": BillingAgent()
        }

    def route_inquiry(self, inquiry):
        if "technical" in inquiry.lower():
            return self.agents["technical"].respond(inquiry)
        elif "bill" in inquiry.lower() or "payment" in inquiry.lower():
            return self.agents["billing"].respond(inquiry)
        else:
            return self.agents["general"].respond(inquiry)

class GeneralAgent:
    def respond(self, inquiry):
        return f"General response: Thank you for your inquiry about '{inquiry}'. How may I assist you further?"

class TechnicalAgent:
    def respond(self, inquiry):
        return f"Technical support: I understand you're having a technical issue with '{inquiry}'. Let's troubleshoot this step-by-step."

class BillingAgent:
    def respond(self, inquiry):
        return f"Billing department: I can help you with your concern about '{inquiry}'. Can you provide more details about your account?"

support_system = CustomerSupportSystem()
print(support_system.route_inquiry("I can't log into my account"))
print(support_system.route_inquiry("When is my next bill due?"))
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Content Moderation

Using LLM-based agents for content moderation in a social media platform to detect and flag inappropriate content.

```python
import random

class ContentModerationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = [
            TextModerationAgent(),
            ImageModerationAgent(),
            ContextAnalysisAgent()
        ]

    def moderate_content(self, content):
        results = [agent.analyze(content) for agent in self.agents]
        return any(results)  # Content is flagged if any agent flags it

class TextModerationAgent:
    def analyze(self, content):
        # Simplified text analysis (in reality, this would use NLP techniques)
        forbidden_words = ["hate", "violence", "abuse"]
        return any(word in content.lower() for word in forbidden_words)

class ImageModerationAgent:
    def analyze(self, content):
        # Simplified image analysis (in reality, this would use computer vision)
        return random.random() < 0.1  # 10% chance of flagging an image

class ContextAnalysisAgent:
    def analyze(self, content):
        # Simplified context analysis
        return len(content.split()) > 100 and random.random() < 0.05  # 5% chance for long posts

moderation_system = ContentModerationSystem()

posts = [
    "Just had a great day at the park!",
    "I hate when people don't respect others.",
    "Check out this cool image I found online!",
    "A very long post about various topics..." * 10
]

for post in posts:
    result = moderation_system.moderate_content(post)
    print(f"Post: '{post[:30]}...' - Flagged: {result}")
```

Slide 8: Challenges in Implementing LLM-based Agents

While LLM-based agents offer significant advantages, they also present challenges in implementation and management.

```python
import random

class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, name, reliability):
        self.name = name
        self.reliability = reliability

    def process_task(self, task):
        if random.random() < self.reliability:
            return f"{self.name} successfully processed: {task}"
        else:
            return f"{self.name} failed to process: {task}"

def simulate_agent_performance(agents, tasks, iterations):
    results = {agent.name: {"success": 0, "failure": 0} for agent in agents}
    
    for _ in range(iterations):
        for task in tasks:
            for agent in agents:
                outcome = agent.process_task(task)
                if "successfully" in outcome:
                    results[agent.name]["success"] += 1
                else:
                    results[agent.name]["failure"] += 1
    
    return results

agents = [
    LLMAgent("HighReliability", 0.95),
    LLMAgent("MediumReliability", 0.8),
    LLMAgent("LowReliability", 0.6)
]

tasks = ["Data Analysis", "Text Generation", "Image Recognition"]

simulation_results = simulate_agent_performance(agents, tasks, 1000)

for agent, results in simulation_results.items():
    total = results["success"] + results["failure"]
    success_rate = (results["success"] / total) * 100
    print(f"{agent}: Success Rate = {success_rate:.2f}%")
```

Slide 9: Ethical Considerations in LLM Agent Development

Developing LLM-based agents requires careful consideration of ethical implications, including bias mitigation and responsible AI practices.

```python
class EthicalAIFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ethical_guidelines = {
            "fairness": 0.0,
            "transparency": 0.0,
            "privacy": 0.0,
            "accountability": 0.0
        }

    def assess_model(self, model_name, fairness, transparency, privacy, accountability):
        self.ethical_guidelines["fairness"] = fairness
        self.ethical_guidelines["transparency"] = transparency
        self.ethical_guidelines["privacy"] = privacy
        self.ethical_guidelines["accountability"] = accountability
        
        total_score = sum(self.ethical_guidelines.values()) / len(self.ethical_guidelines)
        
        print(f"Ethical Assessment for {model_name}:")
        for guideline, score in self.ethical_guidelines.items():
            print(f"{guideline.capitalize()}: {score:.2f}")
        print(f"Overall Ethical Score: {total_score:.2f}")
        
        if total_score < 0.7:
            print("Warning: This model requires significant ethical improvements.")
        elif total_score < 0.9:
            print("Note: There's room for ethical enhancements in this model.")
        else:
            print("Good: This model demonstrates strong ethical considerations.")

ethical_framework = EthicalAIFramework()

# Assessing two hypothetical models
ethical_framework.assess_model("Model A", 0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.85)
print("\n")
ethical_framework.assess_model("Model B", 0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.6)
```

Slide 10: Scalability and Performance Optimization

Ensuring LLM-based agent systems can scale efficiently and maintain performance under increased load is crucial for real-world applications.

```python
import time
import random
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class ScalableAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self, num_agents):
        self.agents = [Agent(i) for i in range(num_agents)]

    def process_requests(self, requests):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(self.agents)) as executor:
            results = list(executor.map(self.process_request, requests))
        return results

    def process_request(self, request):
        agent = random.choice(self.agents)
        return agent.handle_request(request)

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        self.agent_id = agent_id

    def handle_request(self, request):
        processing_time = random.uniform(0.1, 0.5)  # Simulating variable processing time
        time.sleep(processing_time)
        return f"Agent {self.agent_id} processed request '{request}' in {processing_time:.2f} seconds"

# Simulation
system = ScalableAgentSystem(num_agents=5)
requests = [f"Request {i}" for i in range(20)]

start_time = time.time()
results = system.process_requests(requests)
end_time = time.time()

for result in results:
    print(result)

print(f"\nTotal processing time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Average time per request: {(end_time - start_time) / len(requests):.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 11: Continuous Learning and Adaptation

Implementing mechanisms for LLM-based agents to continuously learn and adapt to new information and changing environments.

```python
import random

class AdaptiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.knowledge_base = set()
        self.performance_history = []

    def learn(self, new_information):
        self.knowledge_base.add(new_information)
        print(f"{self.name} learned: {new_information}")

    def perform_task(self, task):
        relevant_knowledge = self.knowledge_base.intersection(set(task.split()))
        performance = len(relevant_knowledge) / len(task.split())
        self.performance_history.append(performance)
        return performance

    def adapt(self):
        if len(self.performance_history) >= 5:
            recent_performance = sum(self.performance_history[-5:]) / 5
            if recent_performance < 0.6:
                print(f"{self.name} is adapting due to low recent performance.")
                self.learn(f"Improvement_{random.randint(1, 100)}")

def simulate_adaptive_learning(agent, tasks, iterations):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        task = random.choice(tasks)
        performance = agent.perform_task(task)
        print(f"{agent.name} performed '{task}' with performance: {performance:.2f}")
        agent.adapt()
        if random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% chance of learning something new
            agent.learn(f"NewConcept_{random.randint(1, 100)}")

adaptive_agent = AdaptiveAgent("AdaptiveBot")
tasks = [
    "analyze data trends",
    "generate creative content",
    "optimize system performance",
    "predict user behavior"
]

simulate_adaptive_learning(adaptive_agent, tasks, 20)

print(f"\nFinal knowledge base size: {len(adaptive_agent.knowledge_base)}")
print(f"Average performance: {sum(adaptive_agent.performance_history) / len(adaptive_agent.performance_history):.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Integration with External Systems

Demonstrating how LLM-based agents can be integrated with external systems and APIs to enhance their capabilities and access real-world data.

```python
import random
import time

class ExternalAPI:
    def fetch_weather(self, location):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        return f"Weather in {location}: {random.choice(['Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Cloudy'])}"

    def fetch_news(self, topic):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        return f"Latest news on {topic}: {random.choice(['Breaking story', 'Update', 'New development'])}"

class IntegratedAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api = ExternalAPI()

    def process_query(self, query):
        if "weather" in query.lower():
            location = query.split("in")[-1].strip()
            return self.api.fetch_weather(location)
        elif "news" in query.lower():
            topic = query.split("about")[-1].strip()
            return self.api.fetch_news(topic)
        else:
            return "I'm sorry, I can't process that query."

agent = IntegratedAgent()
print(agent.process_query("What's the weather in New York?"))
print(agent.process_query("Tell me news about technology"))
```

Slide 13: Future Directions for LLM-based Agents

```python
class FutureAgentCapability:
    def __init__(self, name, current_level, potential_level):
        self.name = name
        self.current_level = current_level
        self.potential_level = potential_level

    def calculate_growth_potential(self):
        return self.potential_level - self.current_level

future_capabilities = [
    FutureAgentCapability("Multimodal Understanding", 3, 9),
    FutureAgentCapability("Causal Reasoning", 4, 8),
    FutureAgentCapability("Long-term Memory", 2, 7),
    FutureAgentCapability("Ethical Decision Making", 5, 9),
    FutureAgentCapability("Self-Improvement", 1, 8)
]

for capability in future_capabilities:
    growth = capability.calculate_growth_potential()
    print(f"{capability.name}: Current Level = {capability.current_level}, "
          f"Potential Level = {capability.potential_level}, "
          f"Growth Potential = {growth}")

print("\nTop 3 Areas for Future Research:")
sorted_capabilities = sorted(future_capabilities, 
                             key=lambda x: x.calculate_growth_potential(), 
                             reverse=True)
for i, capability in enumerate(sorted_capabilities[:3], 1):
    print(f"{i}. {capability.name}")
```
