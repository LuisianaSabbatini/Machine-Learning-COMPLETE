## Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning L1 and L2 in Keras

Slide 1: Introduction to Regularization in Deep Learning

Regularization is a technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Regularization helps to improve the model's generalization performance by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to learn simpler and more generalizable patterns.

Slide 2: L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso Regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the weights. This penalty term encourages sparse solutions, where some weights are driven to zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the model's complexity.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.regularizers import l1

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l1(0.01), input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_regularizer=l1(0.01)))
```

Slide 3: L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge Regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the weights. This penalty term encourages small weights, but unlike L1 regularization, it does not drive weights to exactly zero. L2 regularization is effective in reducing the impact of correlated features.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.regularizers import l2

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01), input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)))
```

Slide 4: Choosing Between L1 and L2 Regularization

The choice between L1 and L2 regularization depends on the specific problem and the desired behavior. L1 regularization is preferred when feature selection is important and sparse solutions are desired. L2 regularization is preferred when all features are potentially relevant, and small but non-zero weights are acceptable.

```python
# Example: Using both L1 and L2 regularization
from keras.regularizers import l1_l2

model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01), input_shape=(784,)))
```

Slide 5: Early Stopping

Early stopping is another regularization technique that monitors the validation loss during training and stops the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data and helps to improve generalization performance.

```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stop])
```

Slide 6: Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out (sets to zero) a fraction of the input units or hidden units during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by introducing noise and reducing the co-adaptation of units. Dropout is commonly used in deep neural networks.

```python
from keras.layers import Dropout

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

Slide 7: Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a regularization technique that artificially increases the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help to improve the model's generalization performance and prevent overfitting, especially in computer vision tasks.

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

train_generator = datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
model.fit_generator(train_generator, epochs=10)
```

Slide 8: Batch Normalization

Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the inputs to each layer in a neural network, reducing the internal covariate shift problem and allowing for higher learning rates and better training performance. It also has a regularizing effect by introducing noise and reducing the model's sensitivity to small changes in the input.

```python
from keras.layers import BatchNormalization

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

Slide 9: Combining Regularization Techniques

In practice, it is common to combine multiple regularization techniques to achieve better generalization performance. For example, you can use L1 or L2 regularization with dropout and early stopping. The choice of techniques and their hyperparameters should be tuned based on the specific problem and the available computational resources.

```python
# Example: Combining L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01), input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01)))

early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stop])
```
