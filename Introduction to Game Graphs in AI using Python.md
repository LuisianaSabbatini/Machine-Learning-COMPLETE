## Introduction to Game Graphs in AI using Python

Slide 1: 
Introduction to Game Graphs in AI

Game graphs, also known as game trees, are a fundamental concept in AI and game theory. They represent the possible moves and outcomes in a game, allowing AI agents to reason about optimal strategies. In this slideshow, we'll explore game graphs using Python, focusing on beginner-level concepts and actionable examples.

Slide 2: 
Representing a Game Graph

A game graph is typically represented as a tree data structure, where each node represents a game state, and the edges represent the possible moves from that state. Python's built-in data structures, such as dictionaries and lists, can be used to create and manipulate game graphs.

```python
# Representing a simple game graph
game_graph = {
    'root': [('a', 'b')],
    'a': [('c', 'd')],
    'b': [],
    'c': [],
    'd': []
}
```

Slide 3: 
Game Graph Traversal

Traversing a game graph is essential for evaluating possible moves and outcomes. Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are common traversal algorithms used in game AI. In Python, these can be implemented using recursive functions or data structures like queues and stacks.

```python
# Depth-first search traversal
def dfs(graph, node):
    print(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(graph, neighbor)

# Breadth-first search traversal
def bfs(graph, start):
    queue = [start]
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            print(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node])
```

Slide 4: 
Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a fundamental technique for finding optimal moves in two-player games like chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe. It assumes that both players are trying to maximize their chances of winning, and it recursively explores the game tree to determine the best move.

```python
# Minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe
def minimax(board, player):
    # Check for terminal states
    winner = check_winner(board)
    if winner == 'X':
        return 1
    elif winner == 'O':
        return -1
    elif is_draw(board):
        return 0

    # Recursively explore moves
    best_score = -float('inf') if player == 'X' else float('inf')
    for move in get_available_moves(board):
        new_board = make_move(board, move, player)
        score = minimax(new_board, 'O' if player == 'X' else 'X')
        best_score = max(best_score, score) if player == 'X' else min(best_score, score)

    return best_score
```

Slide 5: 
Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used with the Minimax algorithm to improve its efficiency by pruning branches of the game tree that are guaranteed to be suboptimal. It reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, leading to significant performance improvements in complex games.

```python
# Alpha-beta pruning with Minimax
def alphabeta(board, player, alpha, beta):
    # Check for terminal states
    winner = check_winner(board)
    if winner == 'X':
        return 1
    elif winner == 'O':
        return -1
    elif is_draw(board):
        return 0

    # Recursively explore moves with pruning
    if player == 'X':
        best_score = -float('inf')
        for move in get_available_moves(board):
            new_board = make_move(board, move, player)
            score = alphabeta(new_board, 'O', alpha, beta)
            best_score = max(best_score, score)
            alpha = max(alpha, best_score)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Prune
        return best_score
    else:
        best_score = float('inf')
        for move in get_available_moves(board):
            new_board = make_move(board, move, player)
            score = alphabeta(new_board, 'X', alpha, beta)
            best_score = min(best_score, score)
            beta = min(beta, best_score)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Prune
        return best_score
```

Slide 6: 
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful algorithm used in AI for games with large or complex game trees, such as Go or chess. It combines random sampling with tree search to efficiently explore the game space and make informed decisions.

```python
import random

# MCTS for a simple game
def mcts(game, num_iterations):
    root = game.get_initial_state()
    tree = {root: {'visits': 0, 'value': 0}}

    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        node = root
        state = root
        path = [node]

        # Selection
        while not game.is_terminal(state):
            if node not in tree or not tree[node]['children']:
                break
            node, state = select_child(tree, node, state)
            path.append(node)

        # Expansion and simulation
        if game.is_terminal(state):
            value = game.get_reward(state)
        else:
            new_node = game.get_next_state(state)
            tree[new_node] = {'visits': 0, 'value': 0}
            value = simulate(game, new_node)
            path.append(new_node)

        # Backpropagation
        for node in reversed(path):
            tree[node]['visits'] += 1
            tree[node]['value'] += value

    # Select the best child from the root
    return select_best_child(tree, root)
```

Slide 7: 
Reinforcement Learning for Game AI

Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique in AI that allows agents to learn optimal strategies through trial-and-error interactions with an environment. It can be applied to game AI, where the agent learns to make good moves by maximizing a reward signal.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Define the Q-learning model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=4, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(env.action_space.n, activation='linear'))

# Train the model
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = np.argmax(model.predict(state.reshape(1, 4)))
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        target = reward + (1 - done) * np.max(model.predict(next_state.reshape(1, 4)))
        target_vec = model.predict(state.reshape(1, 4))
        target_vec[0][action] = target
        model.fit(state.reshape(1, 4), target_vec, epochs=1, verbose=0)
        state = next_state
```
 
Slide 8: 
Game AI with Neural Networks

Neural networks have proven to be powerful tools for game AI, particularly in complex games like Go and chess. They can learn to evaluate game states and make strategic decisions by training on large datasets of game records.

```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(8, 8, 3)))  # Flatten the board representation
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='tanh'))  # Output the evaluation score

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001))

# Load game data (e.g., chess games)
game_data = load_game_data()

# Preprocess the data
X_train, y_train = preprocess_data(game_data)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)

# Evaluate the model
X_test, y_test = preprocess_data(test_data)
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test loss: {loss}')

# Use the trained model to evaluate game states
board_state = prepare_board_state(game)
evaluation = model.predict(board_state.reshape(1, 8, 8, 3))
print(f'Evaluation score: {evaluation[0][0]}')
```

In this example, a neural network is defined using Keras to evaluate game states. The model takes a flattened representation of the game board as input and outputs an evaluation score. The model is trained on a dataset of game records, preprocessed into input-output pairs (X\_train, y\_train). After training, the model can be used to evaluate new board states by passing them through the model and obtaining the predicted evaluation score.

Note that this is a simplified example, and in practice, more advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, or other architectures may be used depending on the specific game and the type of input data.

Slide 9: 
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Game AI

Deep reinforcement learning combines reinforcement learning with deep neural networks, enabling AI agents to learn directly from raw inputs like game pixels or board states. This powerful approach has been used to create agents that can play complex games at superhuman levels.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('Pong-v0')

# Define the deep Q-learning model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=env.observation_space.shape))
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(env.action_space.n, activation='linear'))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001))

# Train the model using Deep Q-Learning
for episode in range(10000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = np.argmax(model.predict(state.reshape(1, *state.shape)))
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        target = reward + (1 - done) * np.max(model.predict(next_state.reshape(1, *next_state.shape)))
        target_vec = model.predict(state.reshape(1, *state.shape))
        target_vec[0][action] = target
        model.fit(state.reshape(1, *state.shape), target_vec, epochs=1, verbose=0)
        state = next_state
```

Slide 10: 
Game AI with Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. They can be used in game AI to evolve strategies or decision-making policies through mutation and crossover operations on a population of solutions.

```python
import random

# Fitness function for a simple game
def fitness(strategy):
    # Simulate game with the given strategy
    score = simulate_game(strategy)
    return score

# Genetic algorithm
def genetic_algorithm(population_size, num_generations):
    population = initialize_population(population_size)

    for generation in range(num_generations):
        # Evaluate fitness
        fitness_scores = [fitness(strategy) for strategy in population]

        # Selection
        selected = select_parents(population, fitness_scores)

        # Crossover and mutation
        offspring = []
        for parent1, parent2 in zip(selected[::2], selected[1::2]):
            child1, child2 = crossover(parent1, parent2)
            child1 = mutate(child1)
            child2 = mutate(child2)
            offspring.append(child1)
            offspring.append(child2)

        population = offspring

    # Return the best strategy
    best_strategy = max(population, key=fitness)
    return best_strategy
```

Slide 11: 
Game AI with Evolutionary Strategies

Evolutionary strategies are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution. They can be used in game AI to evolve game-playing strategies or decision-making policies by iteratively updating a population of solutions based on their fitness.

```python
import numpy as np

# Fitness function for a game
def fitness(strategy, game):
    # Simulate the game with the given strategy
    score = simulate_game(game, strategy)
    return score

# Evolutionary strategy
def evolutionary_strategy(population_size, num_generations, strategy_dim):
    population = np.random.randn(population_size, strategy_dim)

    for generation in range(num_generations):
        fitness_scores = [fitness(strategy, game) for strategy in population]

        # Update the population
        noise = np.random.randn(population_size, strategy_dim)
        population = population + noise * np.array([fitness_scores]).T

    # Return the best strategy
    best_strategy = population[np.argmax(fitness_scores)]
    return best_strategy
```

Slide 12: 
Game AI with Evolutionary Neural Networks

Evolutionary neural networks combine the power of neural networks with evolutionary algorithms. They can be used in game AI to evolve the weights and architectures of neural networks for evaluating game states or making decisions.

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Fitness function for a game
def fitness(model, game):
    # Evaluate the model's performance in the game
    score = evaluate_model(model, game)
    return score

# Evolutionary neural network
def evolve_neural_network(population_size, num_generations, game):
    population = initialize_population(population_size)

    for generation in range(num_generations):
        fitness_scores = [fitness(model, game) for model in population]

        # Selection, crossover, and mutation
        selected = select_parents(population, fitness_scores)
        offspring = []
        for parent1, parent2 in zip(selected[::2], selected[1::2]):
            child1, child2 = crossover(parent1, parent2)
            child1 = mutate(child1)
            child2 = mutate(child2)
            offspring.append(child1)
            offspring.append(child2)

        population = offspring

    # Return the best neural network
    best_model = max(population, key=lambda model: fitness(model, game))
    return best_model
```
