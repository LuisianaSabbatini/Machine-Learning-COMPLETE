## Mastering Python's F-Strings
Slide 1: Introduction to F-Strings

F-strings, introduced in Python 3.6, provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals. They offer improved performance and flexibility compared to older string formatting methods.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
# Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
```

Slide 2: Basic Syntax

F-strings are created by prefixing a string with 'f' or 'F'. Expressions inside curly braces {} are evaluated at runtime and their string representations are inserted into the string.

```python
x = 10
y = 20
result = f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}"
print(result)
# Output: 10 + 20 = 30
```

Slide 3: Formatting Numbers

F-strings allow easy formatting of numbers, including specifying decimal places, alignment, and padding.

```python
pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")
print(f"Pi padded to 10 characters: {pi:10.2f}")
# Output:
# Pi to 2 decimal places: 3.14
# Pi padded to 10 characters:       3.14
```

Slide 4: String Alignment

F-strings support left, right, and center alignment of strings within a specified width.

```python
text = "Python"
print(f"{text:<10}")  # Left-aligned
print(f"{text:>10}")  # Right-aligned
print(f"{text:^10}")  # Center-aligned
# Output:
# Python    
#     Python
#   Python
```

Slide 5: Date and Time Formatting

F-strings make it easy to format date and time objects using standard format codes.

```python
from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()
print(f"Current date: {now:%Y-%m-%d}")
print(f"Current time: {now:%H:%M:%S}")
# Output (example):
# Current date: 2024-08-03
# Current time: 14:30:45
```

Slide 6: Using Dictionaries in F-Strings

F-strings can access dictionary values directly, making it convenient to format data from dictionaries.

```python
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old and lives in {person['city']}.")
# Output: Bob is 25 years old and lives in New York.
```

Slide 7: Multiline F-Strings

F-strings can span multiple lines, allowing for better code readability when dealing with longer strings.

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 35
occupation = "developer"

message = f"""
Hello, {name}!
You are {age} years old.
Your occupation is {occupation}.
"""
print(message)
# Output:
# Hello, Charlie!
# You are 35 years old.
# Your occupation is developer.
```

Slide 8: Expressions in F-Strings

F-strings can include any valid Python expression, allowing for complex operations within the string.

```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}, and their product is {x * y}.")
print(f"Is {x} greater than {y}? {x > y}")
# Output:
# The sum of 5 and 10 is 15, and their product is 50.
# Is 5 greater than 10? False
```

Slide 9: Calling Functions in F-Strings

F-strings can call functions directly, making it easy to include dynamic content.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

user = "David"
print(f"{greet(user)} Welcome to Python programming.")
# Output: Hello, David! Welcome to Python programming.
```

Slide 10: Debugging with F-Strings

F-strings offer a convenient way to debug by allowing you to print variable names alongside their values.

```python
x = 42
y = "Hello"
print(f"{x=}, {y=}")
# Output: x=42, y='Hello'
```

Slide 11: Formatting with F-Strings vs. Other Methods

F-strings provide a more readable and efficient alternative to older string formatting methods like %-formatting and str.format().

```python
name = "Eve"
age = 28

# %-formatting
print("My name is %s and I'm %d years old." % (name, age))

# str.format()
print("My name is {} and I'm {} years old.".format(name, age))

# f-string
print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")

# All outputs: My name is Eve and I'm 28 years old.
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Data Analysis

F-strings can be useful in data analysis scenarios, making it easy to format and present results.

```python
import statistics

data = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90]
mean = statistics.mean(data)
median = statistics.median(data)
stdev = statistics.stdev(data)

print(f"Data Analysis Results:")
print(f"Mean: {mean:.2f}")
print(f"Median: {median:.2f}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {stdev:.2f}")
# Output:
# Data Analysis Results:
# Mean: 54.89
# Median: 56.00
# Standard Deviation: 28.32
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Log Formatting

F-strings can be used to create well-formatted log messages, including timestamps and log levels.

```python
import time

def log(level, message):
    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(f"[{timestamp}] {level:5}: {message}")

log("INFO", "Application started")
log("ERROR", "Database connection failed")
log("DEBUG", "Processing user input")
# Output (example):
# [2024-08-03 14:45:30] INFO : Application started
# [2024-08-03 14:45:30] ERROR: Database connection failed
# [2024-08-03 14:45:30] DEBUG: Processing user input
```

Slide 14: Best Practices and Tips

F-strings are powerful, but it's important to use them effectively. Keep expressions simple for readability, use appropriate formatting for different data types, and consider breaking long f-strings into multiple lines for better maintainability.

```python
# Good practice: Simple expressions
name = "Grace"
print(f"Hello, {name.upper()}!")

# Avoid complex expressions in f-strings
# Instead of: print(f"Result: {(lambda x: x**2 + 5*x + 4)(3)}")
# Do this:
def complex_calculation(x):
    return x**2 + 5*x + 4

result = complex_calculation(3)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```
