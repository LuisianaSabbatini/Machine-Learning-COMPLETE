## Neural Nets vs Decision Trees in Python
Slide 1: Neural Networks and Decision Trees: A Comparative Analysis

Neural networks and decision trees are both powerful machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. While they operate on different principles, understanding their similarities and differences can provide valuable insights into their strengths and applications.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(100, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(int)

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Sample Data for Classification')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Decision Trees: Structure and Operation

Decision trees are hierarchical structures that make decisions based on asking a series of questions. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or class label.

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

# Create and train a decision tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
dt.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the decision tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plot_tree(dt, filled=True, feature_names=['X1', 'X2'], class_names=['0', '1'])
plt.title('Decision Tree Structure')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Neural Networks: Structure and Operation

Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer. Each connection has a weight, and each neuron applies an activation function to its inputs.

```python
# Create a simple neural network
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 3), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X, y)

# Visualize the neural network architecture
def plot_neural_network(nn):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
    n_layers = len(nn.coefs_) + 1
    layer_sizes = [2] + list(nn.hidden_layer_sizes) + [1]
    
    for i in range(n_layers):
        layer_top = 1
        layer_bottom = -1
        layer_height = (layer_top - layer_bottom) / (layer_sizes[i] - 1)
        for j in range(layer_sizes[i]):
            circle = plt.Circle((i, layer_bottom + j * layer_height), 0.1)
            ax.add_artist(circle)
    
    ax.set_xlim(-0.5, n_layers - 0.5)
    ax.set_ylim(-1.1, 1.1)
    ax.axis('off')
    plt.title('Neural Network Architecture')
    plt.show()

plot_neural_network(nn)
```

Slide 4: Decision Making Process: Decision Trees

Decision trees make decisions by traversing from the root to a leaf node. At each internal node, a feature is evaluated, and the appropriate branch is followed based on the feature's value.

```python
def traverse_tree(tree, feature_names, sample):
    node = 0
    while tree.feature[node] != -2:  # -2 indicates a leaf node
        if sample[feature_names[tree.feature[node]]] <= tree.threshold[node]:
            node = tree.children_left[node]
        else:
            node = tree.children_right[node]
    return tree.value[node]

# Example traversal
sample = {'X1': 0.5, 'X2': -0.3}
result = traverse_tree(dt.tree_, ['X1', 'X2'], sample)
print(f"Decision tree prediction for {sample}: {result}")
```

Slide 5: Decision Making Process: Neural Networks

Neural networks make decisions by propagating input through layers, applying weights and activation functions at each step. The final output is determined by the activation of the output layer neurons.

```python
def forward_pass(nn, X):
    activations = [X]
    for i, layer in enumerate(nn.coefs_):
        z = np.dot(activations[-1], layer) + nn.intercepts_[i]
        a = np.maximum(z, 0)  # ReLU activation
        activations.append(a)
    return activations

# Example forward pass
sample = np.array([[0.5, -0.3]])
activations = forward_pass(nn, sample)
print(f"Neural network activations for {sample}:")
for i, a in enumerate(activations):
    print(f"Layer {i}: {a}")
```

Slide 6: Training Process: Decision Trees

Decision trees are trained using algorithms like ID3, C4.5, or CART. These algorithms recursively split the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain or reduces impurity the most.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate more data for training
X = np.random.randn(1000, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(int)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the decision tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_score = dt.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = dt.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Decision Tree - Train accuracy: {train_score:.4f}")
print(f"Decision Tree - Test accuracy: {test_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 7: Training Process: Neural Networks

Neural networks are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent. The process involves forward propagation of inputs, calculation of loss, and backward propagation of errors to update weights.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Train the neural network
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 3), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_score = nn.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = nn.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Neural Network - Train accuracy: {train_score:.4f}")
print(f"Neural Network - Test accuracy: {test_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 8: Interpretability: Decision Trees

Decision trees are highly interpretable. The decision-making process can be easily visualized and understood by following the path from root to leaf.

```python
from sklearn.tree import export_text

# Generate a textual representation of the decision tree
tree_rules = export_text(dt, feature_names=['X1', 'X2'])
print("Decision Tree Rules:")
print(tree_rules)
```

Slide 9: Interpretability: Neural Networks

Neural networks are often considered "black boxes" due to their complex internal representations. However, techniques like feature importance and activation visualization can provide some insights.

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Compute feature importance
feature_importance = np.abs(nn.coefs_[0]).sum(axis=1)
feature_importance /= feature_importance.sum()

# Visualize feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=['X1', 'X2'], y=feature_importance)
plt.title('Neural Network Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Handling Non-linearity: Decision Trees

Decision trees naturally handle non-linear relationships by creating complex decision boundaries through recursive splitting.

```python
# Generate non-linear data
X = np.random.randn(1000, 2)
y = ((X[:, 0]**2 + X[:, 1]**2) < 1).astype(int)

# Train and visualize decision tree on non-linear data
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
dt.fit(X, y)

# Plot decision boundary
x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1
y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.1),
                     np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.1))
Z = dt.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, alpha=0.8)
plt.title('Decision Tree on Non-linear Data')
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Handling Non-linearity: Neural Networks

Neural networks can approximate any continuous function, making them well-suited for complex, non-linear relationships.

```python
# Train and visualize neural network on non-linear data
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 5), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X, y)

# Plot decision boundary
Z = nn.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, alpha=0.8)
plt.title('Neural Network on Non-linear Data')
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Image Classification

Both decision trees and neural networks can be used for image classification tasks. Let's compare their performance on a simple digit recognition problem.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the digits dataset
digits = load_digits()
X, y = digits.data, digits.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train and evaluate decision tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=10)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
dt_pred = dt.predict(X_test)
dt_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, dt_pred)

# Train and evaluate neural network
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 30), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)
nn_pred = nn.predict(X_test)
nn_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, nn_pred)

print(f"Decision Tree Accuracy: {dt_accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Neural Network Accuracy: {nn_accuracy:.4f}")

# Visualize a misclassified example
misclassified = X_test[dt_pred != y_test]
true_label = y_test[dt_pred != y_test]
dt_pred_label = dt_pred[dt_pred != y_test]
nn_pred_label = nn_pred[dt_pred != y_test]

plt.imshow(misclassified[0].reshape(8, 8), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f"True: {true_label[0]}, DT: {dt_pred_label[0]}, NN: {nn_pred_label[0]}")
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Natural Language Processing

Neural networks, particularly recurrent and transformer architectures, excel in natural language processing tasks. Let's implement a simple sentiment analysis model using a basic neural network.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample dataset
texts = [
    "I love this product!", "Great service, highly recommended!",
    "Terrible experience, avoid at all costs.", "Not worth the money.",
    "Amazing quality and fast delivery!", "Disappointing results.",
    "Absolutely fantastic!", "Waste of time and resources.",
    "Exceeded my expectations!", "Poor customer support."
]
labels = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Vectorize the text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the neural network
nn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 5), max_iter=1000)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = nn.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Sentiment Analysis Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

# Test on a new example
new_text = ["This product is awesome!"]
new_vector = vectorizer.transform(new_text)
prediction = nn.predict(new_vector)
print(f"Sentiment prediction for '{new_text[0]}': {'Positive' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Negative'}")
```

Slide 14: Combining Decision Trees and Neural Networks: Random Forests

Random Forests, an ensemble method, combine multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. This approach leverages the strengths of decision trees while mitigating their tendency to overfit.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(1000, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(int)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
rf_accuracy = rf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {rf_accuracy:.4f}")

# Visualize feature importance
feature_importance = rf.feature_importances_
plt.bar(['X1', 'X2'], feature_importance)
plt.title('Random Forest Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```
