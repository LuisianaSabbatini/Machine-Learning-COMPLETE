## GraphRAG Graph-based NLP with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to GraphRAG

GraphRAG is an innovative approach that combines graph-based knowledge representation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced natural language processing tasks. This method leverages the structural information in graphs to improve the quality and relevance of generated text.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple knowledge graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([('GraphRAG', 'Graph'), ('GraphRAG', 'RAG'), 
                  ('Graph', 'Knowledge Representation'),
                  ('RAG', 'Retrieval'), ('RAG', 'Generation')])

# Visualize the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=3000, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')
plt.title("GraphRAG Concept Map")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Graph-based Knowledge Representation

Graph-based knowledge representation organizes information as interconnected nodes and edges. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of complex relationships between entities.

```python
class KnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.Graph()
    
    def add_entity(self, entity):
        self.graph.add_node(entity)
    
    def add_relation(self, entity1, relation, entity2):
        self.graph.add_edge(entity1, entity2, relation=relation)
    
    def get_related_entities(self, entity):
        return list(self.graph.neighbors(entity))

# Usage example
kg = KnowledgeGraph()
kg.add_entity("Python")
kg.add_entity("Programming Language")
kg.add_relation("Python", "is_a", "Programming Language")

print(kg.get_related_entities("Python"))
# Output: ['Programming Language']
```

Slide 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enhances language models by incorporating external knowledge during text generation. This technique retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

```python
import random

class RAG:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
    
    def retrieve(self, query):
        # Simplified retrieval (in practice, use more sophisticated methods)
        return random.choice(self.knowledge_base)
    
    def generate(self, prompt, retrieved_info):
        # Simulate text generation using retrieved information
        return f"Generated text based on '{prompt}' and '{retrieved_info}'"

# Example usage
kb = ["Python is a high-level programming language.", 
      "Python supports multiple programming paradigms."]
rag = RAG(kb)

query = "Tell me about Python"
retrieved = rag.retrieve(query)
response = rag.generate(query, retrieved)

print(response)
# Output: Generated text based on 'Tell me about Python' and 'Python supports multiple programming paradigms.'
```

Slide 4: GraphRAG Architecture

GraphRAG integrates graph-based knowledge representation with RAG to leverage structural information for improved text generation. This architecture enables more context-aware and relationally informed responses.

```python
class GraphRAG:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph, language_model):
        self.kg = knowledge_graph
        self.lm = language_model
    
    def process_query(self, query):
        relevant_nodes = self.kg.get_relevant_nodes(query)
        subgraph = self.kg.extract_subgraph(relevant_nodes)
        context = self.kg.linearize_subgraph(subgraph)
        response = self.lm.generate(query, context)
        return response

# Simulated usage
kg = KnowledgeGraph()  # Assume this is our knowledge graph
lm = LanguageModel()   # Assume this is our language model
graph_rag = GraphRAG(kg, lm)

response = graph_rag.process_query("What are Python's features?")
print(response)
# Output: A generated response about Python's features based on the knowledge graph and language model
```

Slide 5: Graph Traversal in GraphRAG

Graph traversal is crucial in GraphRAG for extracting relevant information from the knowledge graph. Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are common algorithms used for this purpose.

```python
import networkx as nx
from collections import deque

def bfs_traversal(graph, start_node, max_depth=3):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start_node, 0)])
    result = []

    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.popleft()
        if depth > max_depth:
            break
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))
    
    return result

# Example usage
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('C', 'E')])
traversal_result = bfs_traversal(G, 'A')
print(f"BFS Traversal: {traversal_result}")
# Output: BFS Traversal: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
```

Slide 6: Subgraph Extraction in GraphRAG

Subgraph extraction is essential in GraphRAG to focus on the most relevant information for a given query. This process involves selecting a subset of nodes and edges from the main knowledge graph.

```python
import networkx as nx

def extract_subgraph(G, query_nodes, n_hops=2):
    subgraph_nodes = set(query_nodes)
    for node in query_nodes:
        neighbors = nx.single_source_shortest_path_length(G, node, cutoff=n_hops)
        subgraph_nodes.update(neighbors.keys())
    return G.subgraph(subgraph_nodes)

# Example usage
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('D', 'E'), ('E', 'F')])

query_nodes = ['A', 'F']
subgraph = extract_subgraph(G, query_nodes)

print(f"Nodes in subgraph: {subgraph.nodes()}")
print(f"Edges in subgraph: {subgraph.edges()}")
# Output:
# Nodes in subgraph: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
# Edges in subgraph: [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('D', 'E'), ('E', 'F')]
```

Slide 7: Graph Embedding in GraphRAG

Graph embedding techniques are used in GraphRAG to represent nodes and edges in a continuous vector space. This allows for efficient similarity computations and integration with neural language models.

```python
import numpy as np
from node2vec import Node2Vec

def create_graph_embeddings(G, dimensions=64, walk_length=30, num_walks=200):
    node2vec = Node2Vec(G, dimensions=dimensions, walk_length=walk_length, num_walks=num_walks, workers=4)
    model = node2vec.fit(window=10, min_count=1)
    
    node_embeddings = {}
    for node in G.nodes():
        node_embeddings[node] = model.wv[node]
    
    return node_embeddings

# Example usage
G = nx.karate_club_graph()
embeddings = create_graph_embeddings(G)

# Compute similarity between two nodes
node1, node2 = list(G.nodes())[:2]
similarity = np.dot(embeddings[node1], embeddings[node2]) / (np.linalg.norm(embeddings[node1]) * np.linalg.norm(embeddings[node2]))

print(f"Similarity between node {node1} and node {node2}: {similarity:.4f}")
# Output: Similarity between node 0 and node 1: 0.8765 (example value)
```

Slide 8: Query Processing in GraphRAG

Query processing in GraphRAG involves analyzing the input query, identifying relevant nodes in the knowledge graph, and preparing the context for the language model.

```python
import spacy

class QueryProcessor:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.kg = knowledge_graph
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    
    def process_query(self, query):
        doc = self.nlp(query)
        entities = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents]
        relevant_nodes = self.kg.get_nodes_by_entities(entities)
        subgraph = self.kg.extract_subgraph(relevant_nodes)
        context = self.kg.linearize_subgraph(subgraph)
        return context

# Example usage
kg = KnowledgeGraph()  # Assume this is our knowledge graph
processor = QueryProcessor(kg)

query = "What are the applications of machine learning in healthcare?"
context = processor.process_query(query)
print(f"Generated context: {context}")
# Output: Generated context: (A string representation of the relevant subgraph)
```

Slide 9: Context Integration in GraphRAG

Context integration is a key step in GraphRAG where the retrieved graph information is combined with the input query to guide the language model's text generation process.

```python
class ContextIntegrator:
    def __init__(self, language_model):
        self.lm = language_model
    
    def integrate_context(self, query, graph_context):
        combined_input = f"Query: {query}\nContext: {graph_context}"
        return self.lm.generate(combined_input)

# Example usage
lm = LanguageModel()  # Assume this is our language model
integrator = ContextIntegrator(lm)

query = "Explain the concept of neural networks."
graph_context = "Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes. They are used in deep learning."
response = integrator.integrate_context(query, graph_context)

print(f"Generated response: {response}")
# Output: Generated response: (A detailed explanation of neural networks based on the query and context)
```

Slide 10: Attention Mechanisms in GraphRAG

Attention mechanisms in GraphRAG help focus on the most relevant parts of the graph context during text generation. This approach improves the quality and coherence of the generated responses.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class GraphAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(GraphAttention, self).__init__()
        self.W = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim, bias=False)
        self.a = nn.Linear(2 * output_dim, 1, bias=False)
    
    def forward(self, node_features, adj_matrix):
        h = self.W(node_features)
        N = h.size(0)
        a_input = torch.cat([h.repeat(1, N).view(N * N, -1), h.repeat(N, 1)], dim=1).view(N, N, -1)
        e = self.a(a_input).squeeze(2)
        attention = torch.softmax(e, dim=1)
        return torch.matmul(attention, h)

# Example usage
node_features = torch.randn(5, 10)  # 5 nodes, each with 10 features
adj_matrix = torch.randint(0, 2, (5, 5))  # Random adjacency matrix
attention_layer = GraphAttention(10, 8)
output = attention_layer(node_features, adj_matrix)

print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
# Output: Output shape: torch.Size([5, 8])
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Question Answering System

GraphRAG can be applied to build an advanced question answering system that leverages both structured knowledge and natural language understanding.

```python
class GraphRAGQuestionAnswering:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph, language_model):
        self.kg = knowledge_graph
        self.lm = language_model
    
    def answer_question(self, question):
        relevant_nodes = self.kg.get_relevant_nodes(question)
        subgraph = self.kg.extract_subgraph(relevant_nodes)
        context = self.kg.linearize_subgraph(subgraph)
        answer = self.lm.generate(question, context)
        return answer

# Example usage
kg = KnowledgeGraph()  # Assume this is our knowledge graph about various topics
lm = LanguageModel()   # Assume this is our language model

qa_system = GraphRAGQuestionAnswering(kg, lm)

question = "What are the main factors contributing to climate change?"
answer = qa_system.answer_question(question)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
# Output: 
# Question: What are the main factors contributing to climate change?
# Answer: (A comprehensive answer discussing greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and other relevant factors)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Personalized Recommendation System

GraphRAG can enhance recommendation systems by combining user preferences, item relationships, and natural language descriptions to provide more contextual and explainable recommendations.

```python
class GraphRAGRecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self, user_item_graph, item_description_model):
        self.graph = user_item_graph
        self.description_model = item_description_model
    
    def get_recommendations(self, user_id, n=5):
        user_items = self.graph.get_user_items(user_id)
        candidate_items = self.graph.get_similar_items(user_items)
        
        recommendations = []
        for item in candidate_items:
            item_context = self.graph.get_item_context(item)
            description = self.description_model.generate_description(item, item_context)
            recommendations.append((item, description))
        
        return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:n]

# Example usage
user_item_graph = UserItemGraph()  # Assume this is our user-item interaction graph
description_model = DescriptionModel()  # Assume this is our language model for generating descriptions

recommender = GraphRAGRecommendationSystem(user_item_graph, description_model)

user_id = "user123"
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id)

print(f"Recommendations for user {user_id}:")
for item, description in recommendations:
    print(f"- {item}: {description}")
# Output:
# Recommendations for user user123:
# - Item1: A detailed description of why this item is recommended
# - Item2: Another personalized description for this recommendation
# ...
```

Slide 13: Challenges and Future Directions in GraphRAG

GraphRAG faces challenges in scalability, real-time performance, and maintaining consistency between the graph structure and language model outputs. Future research directions include improving graph update mechanisms, developing more efficient graph embedding techniques, and enhancing the integration of graph structures with large language models.

```python
import time
import networkx as nx
import random

def benchmark_graph_operations(graph, num_iterations=1000):
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        random_node = random.choice(list(graph.nodes()))
        subgraph = graph.subgraph(graph.neighbors(random_node))
        nx.pagerank(subgraph)
    end_time = time.time()
    return (end_time - start_time) / num_iterations

# Create graphs of different sizes
small_graph = nx.gnm_random_graph(100, 500)
medium_graph = nx.gnm_random_graph(1000, 10000)
large_graph = nx.gnm_random_graph(10000, 100000)

# Benchmark performance
small_time = benchmark_graph_operations(small_graph)
medium_time = benchmark_graph_operations(medium_graph)
large_time = benchmark_graph_operations(large_graph)

print(f"Average operation time:")
print(f"Small graph: {small_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Medium graph: {medium_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Large graph: {large_time:.6f} seconds")
```

Slide 14: Evaluation Metrics for GraphRAG

Evaluating GraphRAG systems requires a combination of traditional NLP metrics and graph-specific measures. This slide explores various evaluation techniques to assess the performance and quality of GraphRAG outputs.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support
import numpy as np

def evaluate_graphrag(true_responses, predicted_responses, graph_relevance_scores):
    # Text-based evaluation
    precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(true_responses, predicted_responses, average='weighted')
    
    # Graph-based evaluation
    avg_graph_relevance = np.mean(graph_relevance_scores)
    
    # Combined score (example)
    combined_score = (f1 + avg_graph_relevance) / 2
    
    return {
        'precision': precision,
        'recall': recall,
        'f1_score': f1,
        'graph_relevance': avg_graph_relevance,
        'combined_score': combined_score
    }

# Example usage
true_responses = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
predicted_responses = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
graph_relevance_scores = [0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5]

results = evaluate_graphrag(true_responses, predicted_responses, graph_relevance_scores)

for metric, value in results.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {value:.4f}")
```
