## Recursive Introspection for Large Language Models
Slide 1: Introduction to RISE for LLMs

RISE (Recursive IntroSpection) is a technique aimed at improving the performance and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves the model recursively analyzing and improving its own outputs, leading to enhanced quality and coherence in generated text.

```python
def rise_process(model, input_text, iterations=3):
    output = model.generate(input_text)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        analysis = model.analyze(output)
        output = model.improve(output, analysis)
    return output

# Example usage
initial_text = "The impact of climate change on biodiversity"
final_output = rise_process(llm_model, initial_text)
print(final_output)
```

Slide 2: The Core Concept of RISE

RISE operates on the principle that an LLM can iteratively refine its outputs by applying its own knowledge and analytical capabilities. This self-improvement loop allows the model to catch and correct errors, enhance coherence, and add depth to its responses.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_rise_improvement(initial_quality, iterations):
    quality = initial_quality
    improvements = []
    for _ in range(iterations):
        improvement = np.random.normal(0.1, 0.05)  # Random improvement
        quality += improvement
        improvements.append(quality)
    return improvements

results = simulate_rise_improvement(0.7, 5)
print("Quality progression:", results)
```

Slide 3: Implementing RISE in Python

To implement RISE, we need to create functions for text generation, analysis, and improvement. Here's a basic structure using a hypothetical LLM class:

```python
class LLM:
    def generate(self, prompt):
        # Implement text generation logic
        pass

    def analyze(self, text):
        # Implement text analysis logic
        pass

    def improve(self, text, analysis):
        # Implement text improvement logic
        pass

def rise_iteration(llm, text, max_iterations=3):
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        analysis = llm.analyze(text)
        text = llm.improve(text, analysis)
    return text

# Usage
llm = LLM()
initial_text = "The effects of exercise on mental health"
improved_text = rise_iteration(llm, initial_text)
print(improved_text)
```

Slide 4: Analysis Phase in RISE

The analysis phase is crucial in RISE. It involves the model examining its own output for various aspects such as coherence, factual accuracy, and style. Here's a simplified implementation:

```python
import re

def analyze_text(text):
    analysis = {}
    
    # Check for coherence (simplified)
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', text)
    analysis['coherence'] = len(sentences) > 1
    
    # Check for factual statements (simplified)
    fact_indicators = ['research shows', 'studies indicate', 'according to']
    analysis['factual_content'] = any(indicator in text.lower() for indicator in fact_indicators)
    
    # Analyze style (simplified)
    analysis['formal_style'] = not bool(re.search(r'\b(gonna|wanna|gotta)\b', text, re.IGNORECASE))
    
    return analysis

# Example usage
sample_text = "Research shows exercise improves mental health. It's gonna make you feel better!"
result = analyze_text(sample_text)
print(result)
```

Slide 5: Improvement Phase in RISE

After analysis, RISE focuses on improving the text based on the identified areas for enhancement. This step involves refining content, style, and structure.

```python
def improve_text(text, analysis):
    improved_text = text
    
    if not analysis['coherence']:
        improved_text += " Furthermore, this topic requires more in-depth exploration."
    
    if not analysis['factual_content']:
        improved_text += " Studies have shown that regular exercise can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety."
    
    if not analysis['formal_style']:
        improved_text = improved_text.replace("gonna", "going to")
        improved_text = improved_text.replace("wanna", "want to")
        improved_text = improved_text.replace("gotta", "have to")
    
    return improved_text

# Example usage
original_text = "Exercise is gonna make you feel good!"
analysis_result = analyze_text(original_text)
improved_text = improve_text(original_text, analysis_result)
print("Original:", original_text)
print("Improved:", improved_text)
```

Slide 6: Recursive Nature of RISE

The power of RISE lies in its recursive application. By repeatedly analyzing and improving the text, the model can achieve significant enhancements over multiple iterations.

```python
def recursive_rise(llm, initial_text, max_iterations=5):
    text = initial_text
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        analysis = llm.analyze(text)
        improved_text = llm.improve(text, analysis)
        if improved_text == text:  # No further improvements
            break
        text = improved_text
        print(f"Iteration {i+1}:", text)
    return text

# Simulated LLM for demonstration
class SimpleLLM:
    def analyze(self, text):
        return analyze_text(text)
    
    def improve(self, text, analysis):
        return improve_text(text, analysis)

llm = SimpleLLM()
initial = "Exercise is good. It makes you feel better."
final = recursive_rise(llm, initial)
print("Final output:", final)
```

Slide 7: Handling Complex Queries with RISE

RISE can be particularly effective for handling complex queries that require multi-step reasoning or in-depth analysis. Let's simulate this process:

```python
import random

def complex_query_handler(query, knowledge_base):
    def generate_response(q, kb):
        # Simplified response generation
        relevant_info = [info for info in kb if any(word in info for word in q.split())]
        return " ".join(relevant_info) if relevant_info else "No relevant information found."

    def analyze_response(response):
        # Simplified analysis
        completeness = len(response.split()) / 50  # Assume 50 words is complete
        return min(completeness, 1.0)

    def improve_response(response, analysis, kb):
        if analysis < 1.0:
            additional_info = random.choice(kb)
            return response + " " + additional_info
        return response

    response = generate_response(query, knowledge_base)
    for _ in range(3):  # 3 RISE iterations
        analysis = analyze_response(response)
        response = improve_response(response, analysis, knowledge_base)
    
    return response

# Example usage
kb = [
    "Climate change affects global temperatures.",
    "Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions.",
    "Deforestation contributes to habitat loss.",
    "Conservation efforts protect endangered species."
]
query = "How does climate change impact the environment?"
result = complex_query_handler(query, kb)
print(result)
```

Slide 8: RISE for Text Summarization

RISE can be applied to improve text summarization tasks. Here's an example of how it might work:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    word_frequencies = {}
    
    for word in words:
        if word not in stop_words:
            if word not in word_frequencies:
                word_frequencies[word] = 1
            else:
                word_frequencies[word] += 1
    
    sentence_scores = {}
    for sentence in sentences:
        for word in word_tokenize(sentence.lower()):
            if word in word_frequencies:
                if sentence not in sentence_scores:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] = word_frequencies[word]
                else:
                    sentence_scores[sentence] += word_frequencies[word]
    
    summary_sentences = sorted(sentence_scores, key=sentence_scores.get, reverse=True)[:num_sentences]
    summary = ' '.join(summary_sentences)
    return summary

def rise_summarize(text, iterations=3):
    summary = summarize_text(text)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        summary = summarize_text(summary, num_sentences=max(3, len(sent_tokenize(summary)) - 1))
    return summary

# Example usage
long_text = """
Climate change is a pressing global issue with far-reaching consequences. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise are just a few of the challenges we face. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. The impacts of climate change are diverse, affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and human health. Polar ice caps are melting, threatening Arctic wildlife and coastal communities. Droughts and floods are becoming more frequent, impacting food security worldwide. To address this crisis, we need urgent action on multiple fronts. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting and restoring natural habitats. International cooperation and policy changes are crucial in combating this global threat.
"""

summary = rise_summarize(long_text)
print("RISE Summary:", summary)
```

Slide 9: RISE for Sentiment Analysis Refinement

RISE can enhance sentiment analysis by recursively refining the analysis to capture nuances and context. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
import re
from textblob import TextBlob

def basic_sentiment_analysis(text):
    return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity

def context_aware_sentiment(text):
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', text)
    sentiments = [basic_sentiment_analysis(sentence) for sentence in sentences]
    return sum(sentiments) / len(sentiments) if sentiments else 0

def rise_sentiment_analysis(text, iterations=3):
    sentiment = context_aware_sentiment(text)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        if sentiment > 0:
            text += " This text has a positive tone."
        elif sentiment < 0:
            text += " This text has a negative tone."
        else:
            text += " This text has a neutral tone."
        sentiment = context_aware_sentiment(text)
    return sentiment, text

# Example usage
sample_text = "The product has some flaws, but overall it's quite good. The customer service could be improved."
final_sentiment, refined_text = rise_sentiment_analysis(sample_text)
print(f"Final Sentiment: {final_sentiment}")
print(f"Refined Text: {refined_text}")
```

Slide 10: RISE for Content Generation

RISE can be used to iteratively improve content generation, ensuring higher quality and more coherent outputs. Here's a simplified example:

```python
import random

def generate_content(topic, length=5):
    words = topic.split() + ["is", "important", "because", "it", "affects", "our", "daily", "lives"]
    return " ".join(random.choices(words, k=length))

def evaluate_content(text):
    unique_words = len(set(text.split()))
    total_words = len(text.split())
    return unique_words / total_words if total_words > 0 else 0

def rise_content_generation(topic, iterations=5):
    content = generate_content(topic)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        quality = evaluate_content(content)
        if quality < 0.7:  # Arbitrary threshold
            new_content = generate_content(topic, length=len(content.split()) + 2)
            content = f"{content} {new_content}"
    return content

# Example usage
topic = "artificial intelligence ethics"
final_content = rise_content_generation(topic)
print(f"Generated content on '{topic}':")
print(final_content)
```

Slide 11: RISE for Question Answering Systems

RISE can enhance question answering systems by recursively refining answers for improved accuracy and completeness. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
def simple_qa_system(question, knowledge_base):
    for q, a in knowledge_base.items():
        if question.lower() in q.lower():
            return a
    return "I don't have an answer to that question."

def analyze_answer(answer):
    word_count = len(answer.split())
    return min(word_count / 20, 1.0)  # Assume 20 words is a complete answer

def improve_answer(answer, question, knowledge_base):
    if answer == "I don't have an answer to that question.":
        return simple_qa_system(question, knowledge_base)
    for q, a in knowledge_base.items():
        if question.lower() in q.lower() and a not in answer:
            return f"{answer} {a}"
    return answer

def rise_qa_system(question, knowledge_base, iterations=3):
    answer = simple_qa_system(question, knowledge_base)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        quality = analyze_answer(answer)
        if quality < 1.0:
            answer = improve_answer(answer, question, knowledge_base)
    return answer

# Example usage
kb = {
    "What is machine learning?": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.",
    "How does machine learning work?": "Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to learn patterns in data.",
    "What are applications of machine learning?": "Machine learning is used in various fields including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics."
}

question = "What is machine learning?"
answer = rise_qa_system(question, kb)
print(f"Q: {question}")
print(f"A: {answer}")
```

Slide 12: RISE for Code Generation and Optimization

RISE can be applied to code generation tasks, iteratively improving the generated code for better efficiency and readability. Here's a simplified example:

```python
import re

def generate_initial_code(task):
    # Simplified code generation
    if "sort" in task.lower():
        return "def sort_list(lst):\n    return sorted(lst)"
    elif "fibonacci" in task.lower():
        return "def fibonacci(n):\n    return n if n <= 1 else fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)"
    else:
        return "def unknown_task():\n    pass"

def analyze_code(code):
    lines = code.split('\n')
    analysis = {
        "line_count": len(lines),
        "has_comments": any(line.strip().startswith('#') for line in lines),
        "has_docstring": '"""' in code or "'''" in code,
        "complexity": len(re.findall(r'\bif\b|\bfor\b|\bwhile\b', code))
    }
    return analysis

def improve_code(code, analysis):
    if not analysis["has_docstring"]:
        code = f'"""\nThis function needs a description.\n"""\n{code}'
    if not analysis["has_comments"]:
        code = f"# This code needs comments\n{code}"
    if analysis["complexity"] > 2:
        code += "\n# Consider simplifying this function"
    return code

def rise_code_generation(task, iterations=3):
    code = generate_initial_code(task)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        analysis = analyze_code(code)
        code = improve_code(code, analysis)
    return code

# Example usage
task = "Create a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"
optimized_code = rise_code_generation(task)
print(f"Optimized code for '{task}':")
print(optimized_code)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: RISE in Natural Language Understanding

Imagine a virtual assistant using RISE to improve its understanding and response to user queries. Here's a simplified simulation:

```python
import random

def initial_response(query):
    responses = {
        "weather": "The weather today is sunny.",
        "news": "Here are the top headlines for today.",
        "default": "I'm not sure how to answer that."
    }
    for key in responses:
        if key in query.lower():
            return responses[key]
    return responses["default"]

def analyze_response(response, query):
    relevance = len(set(query.split()) & set(response.split())) / len(query.split())
    completeness = len(response.split()) / 10  # Assume 10 words is complete
    return min(relevance, completeness)

def improve_response(response, query, quality):
    if quality < 0.5:
        additional_info = {
            "weather": " The temperature is 72°F with a gentle breeze.",
            "news": " The most discussed topic is technological advancements.",
            "default": " I'd be happy to assist you with more specific questions."
        }
        for key in additional_info:
            if key in query.lower():
                return response + additional_info[key]
    return response

def rise_virtual_assistant(query, iterations=3):
    response = initial_response(query)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        quality = analyze_response(response, query)
        response = improve_response(response, query, quality)
    return response

# Example usage
user_query = "What's the weather like today?"
final_response = rise_virtual_assistant(user_query)
print(f"User: {user_query}")
print(f"Assistant: {final_response}")
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: RISE in Content Moderation

RISE can be applied to content moderation systems to improve accuracy and context awareness. Here's a simplified implementation:

```python
def initial_moderation(text):
    offensive_words = ["bad", "stupid", "hate"]
    return any(word in text.lower() for word in offensive_words)

def analyze_context(text):
    positive_phrases = ["not bad", "don't hate", "no stupid"]
    return any(phrase in text.lower() for phrase in positive_phrases)

def rise_content_moderation(text, iterations=3):
    is_offensive = initial_moderation(text)
    for _ in range(iterations):
        if is_offensive:
            context_check = analyze_context(text)
            if context_check:
                is_offensive = False
                break
    return is_offensive

# Example usage
content = "I don't hate broccoli, it's not bad for health."
moderation_result = rise_content_moderation(content)
print(f"Content: {content}")
print(f"Is offensive: {moderation_result}")
```

Slide 15: Limitations and Considerations of RISE

While RISE can significantly improve LLM outputs, it's important to consider its limitations:

1. Computational cost: Multiple iterations can be resource-intensive.
2. Potential for over-refinement: Excessive iterations might lead to verbose or overly complex outputs.
3. Dependency on initial output quality: RISE improvements are limited by the quality of the initial generation.

To address these issues, consider implementing:

```python
def adaptive_rise(llm, input_text, max_iterations=5, quality_threshold=0.9):
    output = llm.generate(input_text)
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        quality = llm.evaluate_quality(output)
        if quality >= quality_threshold:
            break
        analysis = llm.analyze(output)
        output = llm.improve(output, analysis)
    return output, i + 1

# Example usage (pseudo-code)
# result, iterations = adaptive_rise(llm_model, "Explain quantum computing")
# print(f"Final output after {iterations} iterations: {result}")
```

This approach allows for dynamic adjustment of iterations based on output quality.
