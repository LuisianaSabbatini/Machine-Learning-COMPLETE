## Introducing Geometric Hypergraph Neural Networks in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Geometric Hypergraph Neural Networks

Geometric Hypergraph Neural Networks (GHNNs) are a novel class of neural networks designed to process complex relational data represented as hypergraphs. These networks extend traditional graph neural networks to capture higher-order relationships between entities, making them particularly useful for applications in molecular biology, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.

```python
import torch
import torch_geometric
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class GeometricHypergraphNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(GeometricHypergraphNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, 16)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(16, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        return x
```

Slide 2: Understanding Hypergraphs

A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph where edges can connect any number of vertices. In a hypergraph, these edges are called hyperedges. This structure allows for the representation of complex relationships that go beyond pairwise connections.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_hypergraph():
    H = nx.Graph()
    H.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    hyperedges = [{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}]
    for i, edge in enumerate(hyperedges):
        H.add_node(f"e{i}")
        for node in edge:
            H.add_edge(node, f"e{i}")
    return H

H = create_hypergraph()
pos = nx.spring_layout(H)
nx.draw(H, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500)
plt.title("Hypergraph Visualization")
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Hypergraph Representation in Python

To work with hypergraphs in Python, we can use various data structures. One common approach is to use a sparse matrix representation for the incidence matrix, which shows the relationships between nodes and hyperedges.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def create_incidence_matrix(num_nodes, hyperedges):
    data = []
    row_indices = []
    col_indices = []
    for i, edge in enumerate(hyperedges):
        for node in edge:
            data.append(1)
            row_indices.append(node)
            col_indices.append(i)
    return csr_matrix((data, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(num_nodes, len(hyperedges)))

num_nodes = 5
hyperedges = [{0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}]
incidence_matrix = create_incidence_matrix(num_nodes, hyperedges)
print("Incidence Matrix:")
print(incidence_matrix.toarray())
```

Slide 4: Hypergraph Convolution

Hypergraph convolution is a key operation in GHNNs. It generalizes the concept of graph convolution to hypergraphs, allowing information to flow between nodes connected by hyperedges.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def hypergraph_convolution(X, H, W):
    # X: node features, H: incidence matrix, W: learnable weight matrix
    D_v = torch.sum(H, dim=1)
    D_e = torch.sum(H, dim=0)
    L = torch.eye(H.shape[0]) - torch.matmul(H, torch.matmul(torch.diag(1/D_e), H.t()))
    L_sym = torch.matmul(torch.diag(1/torch.sqrt(D_v)), torch.matmul(L, torch.diag(1/torch.sqrt(D_v))))
    return torch.matmul(torch.matmul(L_sym, X), W)

# Example usage
num_nodes, num_features, num_hyperedges = 5, 3, 3
X = torch.randn(num_nodes, num_features)
H = torch.tensor([[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]], dtype=torch.float)
W = torch.randn(num_features, num_features)

output = hypergraph_convolution(X, H, W)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("Output:", output)
```

Slide 5: Building a GHNN Model

Now that we understand the basic components, let's build a simple GHNN model using PyTorch Geometric, a library for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class GHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super(GHNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)

# Example usage
in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels = 16, 32, 7
model = GHNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)
x = torch.randn(10, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]], dtype=torch.long)
output = model(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Model output shape:", output.shape)
```

Slide 6: Training a GHNN

Training a GHNN involves defining a loss function, an optimizer, and iterating through the training data. Here's a simple training loop for a node classification task on a hypergraph.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

def train_ghnn(model, x, hyperedge_index, y, num_epochs=100):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    model.train()

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        out = model(x, hyperedge_index)
        loss = F.nll_loss(out, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Example usage
num_nodes, in_channels, num_classes = 10, 16, 7
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5]], dtype=torch.long)
y = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (num_nodes,))

model = GHNN(in_channels, 32, num_classes)
train_ghnn(model, x, hyperedge_index, y)
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Protein Complex Prediction

GHNNs can be applied to predict protein complexes in biological networks. In this example, we'll use a GHNN to identify potential protein complexes based on protein-protein interaction data.

```python
import torch
import torch_geometric
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class ProteinComplexGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_proteins, hidden_dim):
        super(ProteinComplexGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_proteins, hidden_dim)
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, hyperedge_index):
        x = self.embedding.weight
        x = self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)

# Example usage
num_proteins = 1000
hidden_dim = 64
model = ProteinComplexGHNN(num_proteins, hidden_dim)

# Simulated protein interaction data
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, num_proteins, (2, 5000))

# Predict protein complex membership
predictions = model(hyperedge_index)
print("Protein complex membership predictions:", predictions.shape)
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation Systems

GHNNs can be used in recommendation systems to model complex interactions between users, items, and features. Here's an example of using a GHNN for collaborative filtering.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class RecommendationGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_users, num_items, num_features, hidden_dim):
        super(RecommendationGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.user_embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_users, hidden_dim)
        self.item_embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_items, hidden_dim)
        self.feature_embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_features, hidden_dim)
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, hyperedge_index):
        x = torch.cat([self.user_embedding.weight, 
                       self.item_embedding.weight, 
                       self.feature_embedding.weight])
        x = self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)

# Example usage
num_users, num_items, num_features = 1000, 5000, 100
hidden_dim = 64
model = RecommendationGHNN(num_users, num_items, num_features, hidden_dim)

# Simulated interaction data
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, num_users + num_items + num_features, (2, 10000))

# Predict user-item interactions
predictions = model(hyperedge_index)
print("User-item interaction predictions:", predictions.shape)
```

Slide 9: Hypergraph Pooling

Hypergraph pooling is an important operation in GHNNs that allows the network to learn hierarchical representations of the hypergraph structure. Here's an example of a simple hypergraph pooling layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

class HypergraphPooling(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, ratio=0.5):
        super(HypergraphPooling, self).__init__()
        self.ratio = ratio
        self.score_layer = torch.nn.Linear(in_channels, 1)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        score = self.score_layer(x).squeeze()
        perm = torch.argsort(score, descending=True)
        perm = perm[:int(self.ratio * len(perm))]
        x = x[perm]
        mask = torch.zeros(hyperedge_index.size(1), dtype=torch.bool)
        mask[torch.any(hyperedge_index[0].unsqueeze(0) == perm.unsqueeze(1), dim=0)] = True
        hyperedge_index = hyperedge_index[:, mask]
        return x, hyperedge_index

# Example usage
in_channels = 32
pooling = HypergraphPooling(in_channels)
x = torch.randn(100, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 200))

pooled_x, pooled_hyperedge_index = pooling(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Pooled node features shape:", pooled_x.shape)
print("Pooled hyperedge index shape:", pooled_hyperedge_index.shape)
```

Slide 10: Attention Mechanism in GHNNs

Incorporating attention mechanisms into GHNNs can help the model focus on the most important parts of the hypergraph structure. Here's an example of a hypergraph attention layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

class HypergraphAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(HypergraphAttention, self).__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(in_channels, out_channels)
        self.att = torch.nn.Linear(2 * out_channels, 1)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        x = self.linear(x)
        row, col = hyperedge_index
        h = torch.cat([x[row], x[col]], dim=1)
        alpha = F.leaky_relu(self.att(h).squeeze(), negative_slope=0.2)
        alpha = torch_geometric.utils.softmax(alpha, col)
        return torch_geometric.utils.scatter_('add', alpha * x[row], col, dim_size=x.size(0))

# Example usage
in_channels, out_channels = 16, 32
attention = HypergraphAttention(in_channels, out_channels)
x = torch.randn(100, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 200))

output = attention(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Attention output shape:", output.shape)
```

Slide 11: Handling Dynamic Hypergraphs

In many real-world scenarios, hypergraphs can be dynamic, with nodes and hyperedges changing over time. Here's an example of how to handle dynamic hypergraphs in a GHNN model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class DynamicGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super(DynamicGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)
        self.gru = torch.nn.GRU(out_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index_list):
        hidden = None
        outputs = []
        for hyperedge_index in hyperedge_index_list:
            x = self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index)
            x = F.relu(x)
            x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
            x, hidden = self.gru(x.unsqueeze(0), hidden)
            outputs.append(x.squeeze(0))
        return torch.stack(outputs)

# Example usage
in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels = 16, 32, 64
model = DynamicGHNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)

# Simulating a dynamic hypergraph with 3 time steps
num_nodes = 100
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)
hyperedge_index_list = [
    torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 200)) for _ in range(3)
]

output = model(x, hyperedge_index_list)
print("Dynamic GHNN output shape:", output.shape)
```

Slide 12: Interpretability in GHNNs

Interpretability is crucial for understanding how GHNNs make decisions. Here's an example of implementing a simple attention-based interpretation mechanism for a GHNN model.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class InterpretableGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super(InterpretableGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)
        self.attention = torch.nn.Linear(out_channels, 1)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index))
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        attention_scores = F.softmax(self.attention(x), dim=0)
        weighted_features = x * attention_scores
        return x, attention_scores, weighted_features

# Example usage
in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels = 16, 32, 64
model = InterpretableGHNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)

num_nodes = 100
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 200))

output, attention_scores, weighted_features = model(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("Attention scores shape:", attention_scores.shape)
print("Weighted features shape:", weighted_features.shape)
```

Slide 13: Regularization Techniques for GHNNs

Regularization is important to prevent overfitting in GHNNs. Here's an example of implementing hyperedge dropout, a regularization technique specific to hypergraph neural networks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class HyperedgeDropout(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, p=0.5):
        super(HyperedgeDropout, self).__init__()
        self.p = p

    def forward(self, hyperedge_index):
        if not self.training:
            return hyperedge_index
        
        mask = torch.rand(hyperedge_index.size(1)) >= self.p
        return hyperedge_index[:, mask]

class RegularizedGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels, dropout_p=0.5):
        super(RegularizedGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)
        self.hyperedge_dropout = HyperedgeDropout(p=dropout_p)

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        hyperedge_index = self.hyperedge_dropout(hyperedge_index)
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, hyperedge_index))
        x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
        x = self.conv2(x, hyperedge_index)
        return x

# Example usage
in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels = 16, 32, 64
model = RegularizedGHNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)

num_nodes = 100
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 200))

output = model(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Regularized GHNN output shape:", output.shape)
```

Slide 14: Scaling GHNNs for Large Hypergraphs

When dealing with large-scale hypergraphs, it's important to implement efficient techniques to handle the increased computational complexity. Here's an example of using node sampling to scale GHNNs to larger hypergraphs.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import HypergraphConv

class ScalableGHNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels, num_samples=10):
        super(ScalableGHNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = HypergraphConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = HypergraphConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)
        self.num_samples = num_samples

    def sample_nodes(self, hyperedge_index, num_nodes):
        unique_nodes = torch.unique(hyperedge_index[0])
        perm = torch.randperm(len(unique_nodes))[:self.num_samples]
        sampled_nodes = unique_nodes[perm]
        mask = torch.isin(hyperedge_index[0], sampled_nodes)
        return hyperedge_index[:, mask], sampled_nodes

    def forward(self, x, hyperedge_index):
        sampled_hyperedge_index, sampled_nodes = self.sample_nodes(hyperedge_index, x.size(0))
        sampled_x = x[sampled_nodes]
        
        h = F.relu(self.conv1(sampled_x, sampled_hyperedge_index))
        h = self.conv2(h, sampled_hyperedge_index)
        
        return h, sampled_nodes

# Example usage
in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels = 16, 32, 64
model = ScalableGHNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)

num_nodes = 10000  # Large number of nodes
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)
hyperedge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 50000))  # Large number of hyperedges

output, sampled_nodes = model(x, hyperedge_index)
print("Scalable GHNN output shape:", output.shape)
print("Number of sampled nodes:", len(sampled_nodes))
```
