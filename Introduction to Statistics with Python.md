## Introduction to Statistics with Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Statistics

Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to make informed decisions. Python makes it easy to perform statistical analysis.

Slide 2: Central Tendency Measures of central tendency describe the central or typical value in a dataset. The mean is the arithmetic average of the data. Code Example:

```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"The mean is: {mean}") # Output: The mean is: 15.0
```

Slide 3: Spread and Dispersion

Measures of spread or dispersion describe how scattered the data is from the central value. The variance and standard deviation are common measures. Code Example:

```python
import math

numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
squared_diffs = [(x - mean)**2 for x in numbers]
variance = sum(squared_diffs) / len(numbers)
std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)
print(f"The standard deviation is: {std_dev}") # Output: The standard deviation is: 6.708203932499369
```

Slide 4: Data Distributions

The distribution of a dataset describes the frequency of different values. Common distributions include normal, binomial, and Poisson. Code Example:

```python
import random

# Simulate coin flips
coin_flips = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(100)]
num_heads = sum(coin_flips)
print(f"Number of heads: {num_heads}") # Output: Number of heads: 53 (this will vary each time due to randomness)
```

Slide 5: Probability

Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring. It helps quantify the uncertainty in data and make predictions. Code Example:

```python
# Probability of rolling a 6 on a fair dice
success = 1  # Desired outcome (rolling a 6)
total_outcomes = 6  # Total possible outcomes
probability = success / total_outcomes
print(f"Probability of rolling a 6: {probability}") # Output: Probability of rolling a 6: 0.16666666666666666
```

Slide 6: Sampling and Estimation

Sampling allows us to estimate population parameters from a subset of data. Larger sample sizes generally lead to more accurate estimates. Code Example:

```python
import random

population = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
sample = random.sample(population, 5)
sample_mean = sum(sample) / len(sample)
print(f"Sample mean: {sample_mean}") # Output: Sample mean: 27.0 (this will vary due to randomness)
```

Slide 7: Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing evaluates whether a claim about a population parameter is likely to be true or not, based on sample data. Code Example:

```python
ages = [25, 30, 28, 35, 32, 40]
sample_mean = sum(ages) / len(ages)
hypothesized_mean = 30
print(f"Is the sample mean different from 30? Mean: {sample_mean}") # Output: Is the sample mean different from 30? Mean: 31.666666666666668
```

Slide 8: Correlation

Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Code Example:

```python
hours_studied = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
exam_scores = [60, 70, 75, 85, 90]
print("Hours studied vs. Exam scores:")
for hours, score in zip(hours_studied, exam_scores):
    print(f"{hours} hours, {score} score")
```

Output:

```
Hours studied vs. Exam scores:
2 hours, 60 score
4 hours, 70 score
6 hours, 75 score
8 hours, 85 score
10 hours, 90 score
```

Slide 9: Simple Linear Regression

Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line. Code Example:

```python
def predict_score(hours):
    return 50 + 4 * hours

hours_studied = 6
predicted_score = predict_score(hours_studied)
print(f"Predicted score if studying for {hours_studied} hours: {predicted_score}") # Output: Predicted score if studying for 6 hours: 74.0
```

Slide 10: Data Visualization

Visualizing data can help uncover patterns and trends that may not be apparent in raw numbers. Code Example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ages = [25, 30, 28, 35, 32, 40]
plt.hist(ages, bins=5, edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Age Distribution")
plt.show() # Output: A histogram plot displaying the distribution of ages.
```

Slide 11: Applications of Statistics Statistical methods find applications in diverse fields, aiding in data-driven decision making. For example, in business, statistics can help optimize pricing strategies, forecast demand, and analyze customer behavior. In healthcare, statistics play a crucial role in clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and evaluating treatment effectiveness. Sports teams use statistics to assess player performance, develop strategies, and make informed decisions during games.
