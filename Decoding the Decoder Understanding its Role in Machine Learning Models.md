## Decoding the Decoder Understanding its Role in Machine Learning Models
Slide 1: What is a Decoder in Machine Learning Models?

The Decoder is a crucial component in many machine learning models, particularly in sequence-to-sequence architectures like transformers. It takes encoded inputs and previously generated tokens to produce context-aware outputs. In essence, the Decoder transforms the abstract representations created by the Encoder into meaningful, human-readable sequences.

Slide 2: Source Code for What is a Decoder in Machine Learning Models?

```python
import random

class SimpleDecoder:
    def __init__(self, vocabulary_size, hidden_size):
        self.vocabulary_size = vocabulary_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.weights = [[random.random() for _ in range(vocabulary_size)] 
                        for _ in range(hidden_size)]
    
    def decode(self, encoded_input):
        output = []
        for vector in encoded_input:
            scores = [sum(v * w for v, w in zip(vector, weight_row)) 
                      for weight_row in self.weights]
            predicted_token = scores.index(max(scores))
            output.append(predicted_token)
        return output

# Example usage
decoder = SimpleDecoder(vocabulary_size=1000, hidden_size=256)
encoded_input = [[random.random() for _ in range(256)] for _ in range(10)]
output = decoder.decode(encoded_input)
print(f"Decoded output: {output}")
```

Slide 3: Target Sequence Embedding

Target sequence embedding is the process of converting raw input data into a format that the Decoder can understand and process. This involves transforming discrete tokens (like words or subwords) into continuous vector representations. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between tokens, allowing the model to work with more meaningful representations.

Slide 4: Source Code for Target Sequence Embedding

```python
class Embedder:
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        self.embedding_matrix = [[random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(embedding_dim)] 
                                 for _ in range(vocab_size)]

    def embed(self, sequence):
        return [self.embedding_matrix[token] for token in sequence]

# Example usage
vocab_size, embedding_dim = 1000, 64
embedder = Embedder(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
input_sequence = [42, 7, 123, 99]  # Example token IDs
embedded_sequence = embedder.embed(input_sequence)
print(f"First token embedding: {embedded_sequence[0][:5]}...")  # Show first 5 values
```

Slide 5: Positional Encoding

Positional encoding is a technique used in transformer models to provide information about the position of tokens in a sequence. Since transformers process input tokens in parallel, they lack inherent understanding of sequence order. Positional encoding adds this crucial information by incorporating unique position-dependent patterns into the token embeddings.

Slide 6: Source Code for Positional Encoding

```python
import math

def positional_encoding(seq_length, d_model):
    position = [[pos for _ in range(d_model)] for pos in range(seq_length)]
    div_term = [math.exp(i * -math.log(10000.0) / d_model) for i in range(0, d_model, 2)]
    
    for pos in range(seq_length):
        for i in range(0, d_model, 2):
            position[pos][i] = math.sin(position[pos][i] * div_term[i // 2])
            position[pos][i + 1] = math.cos(position[pos][i] * div_term[i // 2])
    
    return position

# Example usage
seq_length, d_model = 10, 64
pos_encoding = positional_encoding(seq_length, d_model)
print(f"Positional encoding for position 0: {pos_encoding[0][:5]}...")  # Show first 5 values
```

Slide 7: Masked Self-Attention

Masked self-attention is a key component of the Decoder that ensures it doesn't "peek" at future tokens during training or generation. This mechanism allows the model to attend only to previous tokens in the sequence, maintaining the autoregressive property necessary for generating coherent outputs.

Slide 8: Source Code for Masked Self-Attention

```python
def masked_self_attention(query, key, value, mask):
    # Compute attention scores
    scores = [[sum(q * k for q, k in zip(query_vec, key_vec)) 
               for key_vec in key] for query_vec in query]
    
    # Apply mask
    for i in range(len(scores)):
        for j in range(len(scores[i])):
            if mask[i][j] == 0:
                scores[i][j] = float('-inf')
    
    # Softmax
    exp_scores = [[math.exp(score) for score in row] for row in scores]
    sum_exp_scores = [sum(row) for row in exp_scores]
    attention_weights = [[score / total for score in row] 
                         for row, total in zip(exp_scores, sum_exp_scores)]
    
    # Weighted sum of values
    output = [[sum(weight * v for weight, v in zip(weights, value_vec)) 
               for value_vec in value] for weights in attention_weights]
    
    return output

# Example usage
seq_len, d_model = 4, 8
query = key = value = [[random.random() for _ in range(d_model)] for _ in range(seq_len)]
mask = [[1 if i <= j else 0 for j in range(seq_len)] for i in range(seq_len)]
output = masked_self_attention(query, key, value, mask)
print(f"Output for first token: {output[0][:5]}...")  # Show first 5 values
```

Slide 9: Cross-Attention

Cross-attention is the mechanism that allows the Decoder to leverage information from the Encoder. It enables the Decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each output token, creating a dynamic connection between the input and output.

Slide 10: Source Code for Cross-Attention

```python
def cross_attention(query, key, value):
    # Compute attention scores
    scores = [[sum(q * k for q, k in zip(query_vec, key_vec)) 
               for key_vec in key] for query_vec in query]
    
    # Softmax
    exp_scores = [[math.exp(score) for score in row] for row in scores]
    sum_exp_scores = [sum(row) for row in exp_scores]
    attention_weights = [[score / total for score in row] 
                         for row, total in zip(exp_scores, sum_exp_scores)]
    
    # Weighted sum of values
    output = [[sum(weight * v for weight, v in zip(weights, value_vec)) 
               for value_vec in value] for weights in attention_weights]
    
    return output

# Example usage
seq_len_q, seq_len_kv, d_model = 4, 6, 8
query = [[random.random() for _ in range(d_model)] for _ in range(seq_len_q)]
key = value = [[random.random() for _ in range(d_model)] for _ in range(seq_len_kv)]
output = cross_attention(query, key, value)
print(f"Output for first query: {output[0][:5]}...")  # Show first 5 values
```

Slide 11: Feed-Forward Neural Network

The feed-forward neural network in the Decoder processes the output of the attention layers, applying non-linear transformations to capture complex patterns. This component enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate relationships in the data.

Slide 12: Source Code for Feed-Forward Neural Network

```python
def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)

class FeedForward:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        self.w1 = [[random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(hidden_dim)] for _ in range(input_dim)]
        self.b1 = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(hidden_dim)]
        self.w2 = [[random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(output_dim)] for _ in range(hidden_dim)]
        self.b2 = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(output_dim)]
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # First layer
        hidden = [sum(xi * wi for xi, wi in zip(x, w)) + b for w, b in zip(self.w1, self.b1)]
        hidden = [relu(h) for h in hidden]
        
        # Second layer
        output = [sum(hi * wi for hi, wi in zip(hidden, w)) + b for w, b in zip(self.w2, self.b2)]
        
        return output

# Example usage
input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim = 8, 16, 8
ff_network = FeedForward(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
input_vector = [random.random() for _ in range(input_dim)]
output = ff_network.forward(input_vector)
print(f"Feed-forward output: {output[:5]}...")  # Show first 5 values
```

Slide 13: Linear Classifier and Softmax

The final stage of the Decoder typically involves a linear classifier followed by a softmax operation. This step converts the Decoder's internal representations into probability distributions over the vocabulary, allowing the model to predict the most likely next token in the sequence.

Slide 14: Source Code for Linear Classifier and Softmax

```python
import math

class LinearClassifier:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, num_classes):
        self.weights = [[random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(num_classes)] 
                        for _ in range(input_dim)]
        self.bias = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(num_classes)]
    
    def forward(self, x):
        logits = [sum(xi * wi for xi, wi in zip(x, w)) + b 
                  for w, b in zip(self.weights, self.bias)]
        return self.softmax(logits)
    
    def softmax(self, x):
        exp_x = [math.exp(xi) for xi in x]
        sum_exp_x = sum(exp_x)
        return [xi / sum_exp_x for xi in exp_x]

# Example usage
input_dim, num_classes = 64, 1000
classifier = LinearClassifier(input_dim, num_classes)
input_vector = [random.random() for _ in range(input_dim)]
probabilities = classifier.forward(input_vector)
print(f"Top 5 probabilities: {sorted(probabilities, reverse=True)[:5]}")
```

Slide 15: Real-Life Example: Machine Translation

Machine translation is a common application of Decoder-based models. In this scenario, the Encoder processes the input sentence in the source language, and the Decoder generates the translation in the target language. Let's simulate a simplified version of this process.

Slide 16: Source Code for Machine Translation Example

```python
class SimpleTranslator:
    def __init__(self, source_vocab, target_vocab):
        self.source_vocab = source_vocab
        self.target_vocab = target_vocab
        self.translation_prob = {s: {t: random.random() for t in target_vocab} 
                                 for s in source_vocab}
    
    def translate(self, sentence):
        translated = []
        for word in sentence:
            if word in self.source_vocab:
                probs = self.translation_prob[word]
                translated_word = max(probs, key=probs.get)
                translated.append(translated_word)
            else:
                translated.append(word)  # Unknown word, keep as is
        return translated

# Example usage
source_vocab = ["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"]
target_vocab = ["hola", "mundo", "cómo", "estás", "tú"]
translator = SimpleTranslator(source_vocab, target_vocab)

input_sentence = ["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"]
translation = translator.translate(input_sentence)
print(f"Original: {' '.join(input_sentence)}")
print(f"Translated: {' '.join(translation)}")
```

Slide 17: Real-Life Example: Text Summarization

Text summarization is another application where Decoders play a crucial role. In this example, we'll create a simple extractive summarizer that uses a Decoder-like mechanism to select the most important sentences from a given text.

Slide 18: Source Code for Text Summarization Example

```python
import re

class SimpleSummarizer:
    def __init__(self, num_sentences=3):
        self.num_sentences = num_sentences
    
    def summarize(self, text):
        # Split text into sentences
        sentences = re.split(r'(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\.)(?<=\.|\?)\s', text)
        
        # Calculate sentence scores (simplified)
        scores = [len(set(sentence.lower().split())) for sentence in sentences]
        
        # Select top sentences
        top_sentences = sorted(range(len(scores)), key=lambda i: scores[i], reverse=True)[:self.num_sentences]
        summary = [sentences[i] for i in sorted(top_sentences)]
        
        return ' '.join(summary)

# Example usage
text = """

summarizer = SimpleSummarizer(num_sentences=2)
summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
print(f"Original text length: {len(text)} characters")
