## Overfitting in Machine Learning
Slide 1: Understanding Overfitting in Machine Learning

Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too perfectly, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data. This phenomenon is characterized by high training accuracy but significantly lower test accuracy.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.2

# Create polynomial features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=15)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Predictions
X_test = np.linspace(0, 2, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_poly)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(X, y, label='Training data')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, 'r-', label='Overfitted model')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Detecting Overfitting Through Learning Curves

Learning curves provide a visual diagnostic tool to identify overfitting by plotting training and validation errors over time or epochs. Diverging curves indicate the model is memorizing rather than learning generalizable patterns.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve

def plot_learning_curves(model, X, y):
    train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
        model, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, 
        train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10),
        scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'
    )
    
    train_scores_mean = -np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
    val_scores_mean = -np.mean(val_scores, axis=1)
    
    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores_mean, label='Training error')
    plt.plot(train_sizes, val_scores_mean, label='Validation error')
    plt.xlabel('Training set size')
    plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Example usage
model = LinearRegression()
plot_learning_curves(model, X_poly, y)
```

Slide 3: Cross-Validation for Overfitting Detection

Cross-validation provides a robust method to assess model generalization by partitioning data into multiple training and validation sets. This systematic approach helps identify overfitting by comparing performance across different data splits.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

def assess_overfitting(model, X, y, cv=5):
    # Perform k-fold cross-validation
    kfold = KFold(n_splits=cv, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    
    # Get training and validation scores
    train_scores = []
    val_scores = []
    
    for train_idx, val_idx in kfold.split(X):
        X_train, X_val = X[train_idx], X[val_idx]
        y_train, y_val = y[train_idx], y[val_idx]
        
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        train_scores.append(model.score(X_train, y_train))
        val_scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))
    
    print(f"Training scores: {np.mean(train_scores):.3f} ± {np.std(train_scores):.3f}")
    print(f"Validation scores: {np.mean(val_scores):.3f} ± {np.std(val_scores):.3f}")
    
    return train_scores, val_scores
```

Slide 4: Implementing Early Stopping

Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance during training and stopping when it begins to deteriorate. This technique is particularly useful for neural networks and gradient boosting models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

def create_model_with_early_stopping(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    
    early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
        monitor='val_loss',
        patience=5,
        restore_best_weights=True
    )
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    
    history = model.fit(
        X_train, y_train,
        validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
        epochs=100,
        callbacks=[early_stopping],
        verbose=0
    )
    
    return model, history
```

Slide 5: L1 and L2 Regularization to Combat Overfitting

Regularization techniques add penalty terms to the loss function, discouraging complex models that might overfit. L1 regularization promotes sparsity, while L2 prevents extreme parameter values through weight decay.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso

def compare_regularization(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
    # L1 Regularization (Lasso)
    lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
    lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
    lasso_score = lasso.score(X_test, y_test)
    
    # L2 Regularization (Ridge)
    ridge = Ridge(alpha=0.1)
    ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ridge_score = ridge.score(X_test, y_test)
    
    print(f"Lasso R2 Score: {lasso_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Ridge R2 Score: {ridge_score:.3f}")
    
    # Plot coefficients
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.stem(lasso.coef_)
    plt.title('Lasso Coefficients')
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.stem(ridge.coef_)
    plt.title('Ridge Coefficients')
    plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Dropout Implementation for Neural Networks

Dropout is a powerful regularization technique that randomly deactivates neurons during training, forcing the network to learn robust features and prevent co-adaptation of neurons, effectively reducing overfitting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model_with_dropout():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
        loss='mse',
        metrics=['mae']
    )
    
    return model

# Example usage
X_train_normalized = (X_train - X_train.mean()) / X_train.std()
model = create_model_with_dropout()
history = model.fit(
    X_train_normalized, y_train,
    validation_split=0.2,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    verbose=0
)
```

Slide 7: Data Augmentation to Prevent Overfitting

Data augmentation artificially increases the training set size by creating modified versions of existing samples, helping models learn invariant features and reduce overfitting, particularly effective in computer vision tasks.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

def create_augmentation_pipeline():
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rotation_range=20,
        width_shift_range=0.2,
        height_shift_range=0.2,
        horizontal_flip=True,
        fill_mode='nearest'
    )
    
    # Example usage with a sample image
    img = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)  # Sample image shape
    
    # Generate augmented samples
    aug_iterator = datagen.flow(img, batch_size=1)
    
    # Display original and augmented images
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2))
    for i in range(5):
        plt.subplot(1, 5, i+1)
        plt.imshow(next(aug_iterator)[0].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
        plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
    
    return datagen
```

Slide 8: Ensemble Methods for Reducing Overfitting

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to create a more robust predictor, reducing overfitting through model averaging and diversification. This implementation demonstrates bagging and random forest approaches.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

def compare_ensemble_methods(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
    # Base model (Decision Tree)
    base_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5)
    base_score = base_model.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test)
    
    # Bagging
    bagging = BaggingRegressor(
        base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5),
        n_estimators=100,
        random_state=42
    )
    bagging_score = bagging.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test)
    
    # Random Forest
    rf = RandomForestRegressor(
        n_estimators=100,
        max_depth=5,
        random_state=42
    )
    rf_score = rf.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test)
    
    print(f"Base Model R2: {base_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Bagging R2: {bagging_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Random Forest R2: {rf_score:.3f}")
```

Slide 9: K-Fold Cross-Validation Implementation

K-fold cross-validation systematically evaluates model performance by splitting data into k subsets, training on k-1 folds and validating on the remaining fold. This comprehensive approach provides robust overfitting detection.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

def advanced_kfold_validation(model, X, y, k=5):
    kf = KFold(n_splits=k, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    train_scores = []
    val_scores = []
    mse_scores = []
    
    for fold, (train_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(kf.split(X)):
        X_train_fold = X[train_idx]
        y_train_fold = y[train_idx]
        X_val_fold = X[val_idx]
        y_val_fold = y[val_idx]
        
        model.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)
        
        train_pred = model.predict(X_train_fold)
        val_pred = model.predict(X_val_fold)
        
        train_scores.append(r2_score(y_train_fold, train_pred))
        val_scores.append(r2_score(y_val_fold, val_pred))
        mse_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_val_fold, val_pred))
        
        print(f"Fold {fold+1}:")
        print(f"Training R2: {train_scores[-1]:.3f}")
        print(f"Validation R2: {val_scores[-1]:.3f}")
        print(f"MSE: {mse_scores[-1]:.3f}\n")
    
    return np.mean(train_scores), np.mean(val_scores), np.mean(mse_scores)
```

Slide 10: Bias-Variance Decomposition Analysis

Bias-variance decomposition helps understand the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting by analyzing prediction errors in terms of bias, variance, and irreducible error components.

```python
def bias_variance_decomposition(model, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, n_bootstraps=100):
    predictions = np.zeros((n_bootstraps, len(X_test)))
    
    for i in range(n_bootstraps):
        # Bootstrap sample
        indices = np.random.randint(0, len(X_train), len(X_train))
        X_boot = X_train[indices]
        y_boot = y_train[indices]
        
        # Fit model and predict
        model.fit(X_boot, y_boot)
        predictions[i, :] = model.predict(X_test).ravel()
    
    # Calculate statistics
    expected_pred = np.mean(predictions, axis=0)
    bias = np.mean((y_test - expected_pred) ** 2)
    variance = np.mean(np.var(predictions, axis=0))
    
    print(f"Bias² : {bias:.3f}")
    print(f"Variance: {variance:.3f}")
    print(f"Expected Total Error: {bias + variance:.3f}")
    
    return bias, variance
```

Slide 11: Validation Curves Implementation

Validation curves analyze model performance across different hyperparameter values, helping identify the optimal complexity that balances underfitting and overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve

def plot_validation_curves(model, X, y, param_name, param_range):
    train_scores, val_scores = validation_curve(
        model, X, y,
        param_name=param_name,
        param_range=param_range,
        cv=5,
        scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'
    )
    
    train_mean = -np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
    train_std = np.std(train_scores, axis=1)
    val_mean = -np.mean(val_scores, axis=1)
    val_std = np.std(val_scores, axis=1)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(param_range, train_mean, label='Training score')
    plt.fill_between(param_range, train_mean - train_std,
                     train_mean + train_std, alpha=0.1)
    plt.plot(param_range, val_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
    plt.fill_between(param_range, val_mean - val_std,
                     val_mean + val_std, alpha=0.1)
    plt.xlabel(param_name)
    plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Model Complexity Analysis

Model complexity analysis examines the relationship between model sophistication and performance, helping identify the optimal level of complexity that prevents both underfitting and overfitting through systematic evaluation.

```python
def analyze_model_complexity(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, max_degree=15):
    train_scores = []
    test_scores = []
    model_complexities = range(1, max_degree + 1)
    
    for degree in model_complexities:
        # Create polynomial features
        poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
        X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
        X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)
        
        # Train model
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train_poly, y_train)
        
        # Calculate scores
        train_scores.append(model.score(X_train_poly, y_train))
        test_scores.append(model.score(X_test_poly, y_test))
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(model_complexities, train_scores, label='Training Score')
    plt.plot(model_complexities, test_scores, label='Test Score')
    plt.xlabel('Model Complexity (Polynomial Degree)')
    plt.ylabel('R² Score')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    
    return train_scores, test_scores
```

Slide 13: Real-world Example - Housing Price Prediction

This implementation demonstrates overfitting detection and prevention in a practical housing price prediction scenario, incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

def housing_price_analysis():
    # Generate synthetic housing data
    np.random.seed(42)
    n_samples = 1000
    
    # Features: size, bedrooms, age, location_score
    X = np.random.rand(n_samples, 4)
    X[:, 1] = np.round(X[:, 1] * 5 + 1)  # bedrooms 1-6
    X[:, 2] = X[:, 2] * 50  # age 0-50 years
    
    # Price with some noise
    y = (300000 + X[:, 0] * 200000 + X[:, 1] * 50000 - 
         X[:, 2] * 2000 + X[:, 3] * 100000 + 
         np.random.randn(n_samples) * 20000)
    
    # Split and scale data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    
    # Train multiple models
    models = {
        'Linear': LinearRegression(),
        'Ridge': Ridge(alpha=1.0),
        'Lasso': Lasso(alpha=1.0)
    }
    
    results = {}
    for name, model in models.items():
        model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
        train_score = model.score(X_train_scaled, y_train)
        test_score = model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
        results[name] = {'train_score': train_score, 'test_score': test_score}
        
        print(f"{name} Results:")
        print(f"Training R²: {train_score:.3f}")
        print(f"Test R²: {test_score:.3f}")
        print(f"Overfitting gap: {train_score - test_score:.3f}\n")
    
    return results
```
