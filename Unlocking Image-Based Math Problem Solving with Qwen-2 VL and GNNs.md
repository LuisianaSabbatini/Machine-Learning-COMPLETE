## Unlocking Image-Based Math Problem Solving with Qwen-2 VL and GNNs
Slide 1: Introduction to Image-Based Math Problem Solving

Image-based math problem solving is a challenging task that combines computer vision and natural language processing. Qwen-2 VL and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) offer powerful tools for tackling this challenge. This presentation explores how these technologies can be leveraged to solve mathematical problems presented in image format.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForVisionTextDualEncoding, AutoProcessor

# Load Qwen-2 VL model and processor
model = AutoModelForVisionTextDualEncoding.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat")

# Example function to process an image and question
def process_image_question(image_path, question):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    inputs = processor(images=image, text=question, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs
```

Slide 2: Understanding Qwen-2 VL

Qwen-2 VL is a vision-language model that can understand and process both images and text. It uses a transformer-based architecture to encode visual and textual information, allowing it to reason about the relationship between images and text.

```python
# Simplified Qwen-2 VL architecture
class Qwen2VL(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.image_encoder = ImageEncoder()
        self.text_encoder = TextEncoder()
        self.fusion_layer = FusionLayer()
        self.decoder = Decoder()

    def forward(self, image, text):
        image_features = self.image_encoder(image)
        text_features = self.text_encoder(text)
        fused_features = self.fusion_layer(image_features, text_features)
        output = self.decoder(fused_features)
        return output

# Usage
model = Qwen2VL()
output = model(image, question)
```

Slide 3: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Basics

Graph Neural Networks are a class of deep learning models designed to work with graph-structured data. In the context of math problem solving, GNNs can represent mathematical expressions as graphs, where nodes represent numbers or operations, and edges represent relationships between them.

```python
import torch
import torch_geometric

class SimpleGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = torch_geometric.nn.GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = torch_geometric.nn.GCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x

# Example usage
num_nodes = 10
in_channels = 16
hidden_channels = 32
out_channels = 64
edge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 20))
x = torch.randn(num_nodes, in_channels)

model = SimpleGNN(in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels)
output = model(x, edge_index)
print(output.shape)  # torch.Size([10, 64])
```

Slide 4: Integrating Qwen-2 VL and GNN

To solve image-based math problems, we can combine Qwen-2 VL's image understanding capabilities with GNN's ability to process mathematical structures. Qwen-2 VL extracts relevant information from the image, which is then used to construct a graph representation for the GNN to process.

```python
class MathProblemSolver(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.qwen_vl = Qwen2VL()
        self.gnn = SimpleGNN(in_channels=64, hidden_channels=32, out_channels=16)

    def forward(self, image, question):
        # Extract features using Qwen-2 VL
        vl_features = self.qwen_vl(image, question)
        
        # Construct graph from VL features (simplified)
        num_nodes = 10
        edge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, 20))
        x = vl_features.view(num_nodes, -1)
        
        # Process graph with GNN
        gnn_output = self.gnn(x, edge_index)
        
        return gnn_output

# Usage
solver = MathProblemSolver()
result = solver(image, question)
```

Slide 5: Image Preprocessing for Math Problems

Before feeding images into Qwen-2 VL, it's crucial to preprocess them to enhance relevant features. This may include techniques like binarization, noise removal, and text segmentation.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_math_image(image_path):
    # Read the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Apply adaptive thresholding
    binary = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2)
    
    # Remove noise
    kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.uint8)
    denoised = cv2.morphologyEx(binary, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
    
    # Find contours (potential math symbols)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(denoised, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Draw contours on original image (for visualization)
    result = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
    cv2.drawContours(result, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    
    return result

# Usage
preprocessed_image = preprocess_math_image("math_problem.jpg")
cv2.imshow("Preprocessed Math Problem", preprocessed_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Slide 6: Text Extraction and Parsing

After preprocessing, we need to extract and parse the mathematical text from the image. This involves optical character recognition (OCR) and parsing the extracted text into a structured format.

```python
import pytesseract
from sympy import sympify, Symbol

def extract_and_parse_math(image):
    # Extract text using OCR
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    
    # Clean and normalize the text
    cleaned_text = text.replace(" ", "").replace("ร", "*").replace("รท", "/")
    
    # Parse the mathematical expression
    try:
        expr = sympify(cleaned_text)
        return expr
    except:
        print("Failed to parse expression")
        return None

# Usage
image = preprocess_math_image("math_problem.jpg")
parsed_expr = extract_and_parse_math(image)
print(f"Parsed expression: {parsed_expr}")

# Evaluate the expression
if parsed_expr:
    x = Symbol('x')
    result = parsed_expr.subs(x, 5)  # Substitute x with 5
    print(f"Result when x = 5: {result}")
```

Slide 7: Graph Construction from Mathematical Expressions

Once we have parsed the mathematical expression, we need to convert it into a graph structure that can be processed by our GNN. This involves creating nodes for numbers and operations, and edges for their relationships.

```python
import networkx as nx
from sympy import preorder_traversal

def expression_to_graph(expr):
    G = nx.Graph()
    node_id = 0
    
    def add_node(node):
        nonlocal node_id
        G.add_node(node_id, value=str(node))
        node_id += 1
        return node_id - 1
    
    def traverse(expr, parent=None):
        node_id = add_node(expr)
        if parent is not None:
            G.add_edge(parent, node_id)
        for arg in expr.args:
            traverse(arg, node_id)
    
    traverse(expr)
    return G

# Usage
expr = sympify("x**2 + 2*x + 1")
graph = expression_to_graph(expr)

# Visualize the graph
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pos = nx.spring_layout(graph)
nx.draw(graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')
labels = nx.get_node_attributes(graph, 'value')
nx.draw_networkx_labels(graph, pos, labels, font_size=8)
plt.title("Graph Representation of x**2 + 2*x + 1")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Training the GNN for Math Problem Solving

To solve math problems using our GNN, we need to train it on a dataset of mathematical expressions and their solutions. This involves creating a custom dataset, defining a loss function, and training the model.

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data, DataLoader

class MathDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, num_samples=1000):
        self.data = []
        for _ in range(num_samples):
            x = torch.randn(10, 16)  # 10 nodes, 16 features each
            edge_index = torch.randint(0, 10, (2, 20))
            y = torch.randn(1)  # Random solution
            self.data.append(Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index, y=y))
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Create dataset and dataloader
dataset = MathDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Define model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleGNN(in_channels=16, hidden_channels=32, out_channels=1)
criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        out = model(batch.x, batch.edge_index)
        loss = criterion(out, batch.y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

print("Training complete!")
```

Slide 9: Inference and Solution Generation

After training the GNN, we can use it to solve new math problems. This involves preprocessing the image, extracting the mathematical expression, converting it to a graph, and then using our trained GNN to generate a solution.

```python
def solve_math_problem(image_path, question):
    # Preprocess image
    preprocessed_image = preprocess_math_image(image_path)
    
    # Extract and parse mathematical expression
    expr = extract_and_parse_math(preprocessed_image)
    
    # Convert expression to graph
    graph = expression_to_graph(expr)
    
    # Convert graph to PyTorch Geometric Data object
    x = torch.randn(len(graph.nodes), 16)  # Random features for simplicity
    edge_index = torch.tensor(list(graph.edges)).t().contiguous()
    data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index)
    
    # Use trained GNN to solve the problem
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        solution = model(data.x, data.edge_index)
    
    return solution.item()

# Usage
image_path = "math_problem.jpg"
question = "What is the value of x in the equation?"
solution = solve_math_problem(image_path, question)
print(f"The solution is approximately: {solution:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Solving Geometric Problems

Let's consider a real-life example where we use our system to solve a geometric problem presented in an image. The image contains a diagram of a triangle with labeled sides and angles.

```python
import math

def solve_triangle(side_a, angle_B, angle_C):
    # Convert angles to radians
    angle_B_rad = math.radians(angle_B)
    angle_C_rad = math.radians(angle_C)
    
    # Calculate angle A
    angle_A_rad = math.pi - angle_B_rad - angle_C_rad
    
    # Calculate sides b and c using the sine law
    side_b = side_a * math.sin(angle_B_rad) / math.sin(angle_A_rad)
    side_c = side_a * math.sin(angle_C_rad) / math.sin(angle_A_rad)
    
    return side_b, side_c

# Simulating image processing and data extraction
image_path = "triangle_problem.jpg"
preprocessed_image = preprocess_math_image(image_path)
extracted_data = extract_and_parse_math(preprocessed_image)

# Assuming the extracted data gives us these values
side_a = 5  # Length of side a
angle_B = 45  # Angle B in degrees
angle_C = 60  # Angle C in degrees

# Solve the triangle
side_b, side_c = solve_triangle(side_a, angle_B, angle_C)

print(f"Given a triangle with:")
print(f"Side a = {side_a}")
print(f"Angle B = {angle_B}ยฐ")
print(f"Angle C = {angle_C}ยฐ")
print(f"The solution is:")
print(f"Side b โ {side_b:.2f}")
print(f"Side c โ {side_c:.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Solving Systems of Equations

Another practical application is solving systems of linear equations presented in image format. Our system can extract the equations from the image and solve them using matrix operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_linear_system(A, b):
    try:
        x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
        return x
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        return None

# Simulating image processing and data extraction
image_path = "linear_system.jpg"
preprocessed_image = preprocess_math_image(image_path)
extracted_data = extract_and_parse_math(preprocessed_image)

# Assuming the extracted data gives us these equations:
# 2x + 3y = 8
# 4x - y = 5

A = np.array([[2, 3], [4, -1]])
b = np.array([8, 5])

solution = solve_linear_system(A, b)

if solution is not None:
    print("The solution to the system of equations is:")
    print(f"x = {solution[0]:.2f}")
    print(f"y = {solution[1]:.2f}")
else:
    print("The system has no unique solution.")

# Verify the solution
if solution is not None:
    x, y = solution
    eq1 = 2*x + 3*y
    eq2 = 4*x - y
    print("\nVerification:")
    print(f"2x + 3y = {eq1:.2f} (should be 8)")
    print(f"4x - y = {eq2:.2f} (should be 5)")
```

Slide 12: Handling Complex Mathematical Notations

Some mathematical problems involve complex notations like integrals, derivatives, or special functions. We can extend our system to handle these cases by incorporating specialized libraries and parsing techniques.

```python
from sympy import sympify, integrate, diff, Symbol, parse_expr

def process_complex_math(expression_str):
    try:
        expr = parse_expr(expression_str)
        x = Symbol('x')
        
        # Integration
        integral = integrate(expr, x)
        
        # Differentiation
        derivative = diff(expr, x)
        
        # Evaluation at a point
        value_at_2 = expr.subs(x, 2)
        
        return {
            "original": expr,
            "integral": integral,
            "derivative": derivative,
            "value_at_2": value_at_2
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error processing expression: {str(e)}"

# Example usage
expression = "x**2 * sin(x)"
result = process_complex_math(expression)

for key, value in result.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Slide 13: Visualization of Mathematical Solutions

Visualizing the solutions can greatly enhance understanding. We can use libraries like Matplotlib to create graphs and plots of our mathematical solutions.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_function(expr_str, x_range=(-10, 10)):
    x = Symbol('x')
    expr = sympify(expr_str)
    
    x_vals = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], 1000)
    y_vals = [expr.subs(x, val) for val in x_vals]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals)
    plt.title(f"Graph of {expr_str}")
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.axhline(y=0, color='k')
    plt.axvline(x=0, color='k')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
expr = "x**2 - 4*x + 4"
visualize_function(expr)
```

Slide 14: Error Handling and Robustness

In real-world applications, we need to handle various edge cases and errors gracefully. This includes dealing with poorly formatted images, ambiguous notations, or unsolvable problems.

```python
def robust_math_solver(image_path):
    try:
        preprocessed_image = preprocess_math_image(image_path)
        expr = extract_and_parse_math(preprocessed_image)
        
        if expr is None:
            return "Unable to extract mathematical expression from image"
        
        solution = solve_expression(expr)
        
        if solution is None:
            return "Unable to solve the extracted expression"
        
        return f"Solution: {solution}"
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Image file not found"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

def solve_expression(expr):
    # Implement solving logic here
    # This is a placeholder function
    return expr

# Example usage
result = robust_math_solver("math_problem.jpg")
print(result)
```
