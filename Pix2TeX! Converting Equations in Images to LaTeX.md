## Pix2TeX! Converting Equations in Images to LaTeX
Slide 1: Introduction to Pix2TeX

Pix2TeX is a powerful Python library that converts images containing mathematical equations into LaTeX code. This tool bridges the gap between handwritten or printed equations and their digital representation, making it easier for researchers, students, and professionals to digitize mathematical content.

```python
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
model = Pix2Tex()
latex_code = model.image_to_latex('equation_image.png')
print(latex_code)
# Output: \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x)
```

Slide 2: Installation and Setup

To get started with Pix2TeX, you'll need to install it using pip. Once installed, you can import the library and create an instance of the Pix2Tex model. This model will be used to process images and generate LaTeX code.

```python
# Install Pix2TeX
!pip install pix2tex

# Import and initialize the model
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
model = Pix2Tex()
```

Slide 3: Loading and Preprocessing Images

Before converting an image to LaTeX, it's important to preprocess it. Pix2TeX works best with clear, high-contrast images. Let's load an image and apply some basic preprocessing techniques.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    img = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]
    return img

equation_image = preprocess_image('equation.png')
cv2.imshow('Preprocessed Image', equation_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Slide 4: Basic Usage of Pix2TeX

Now that we have a preprocessed image, let's use Pix2TeX to convert it to LaTeX code. The `image_to_latex` method takes an image file path or a NumPy array as input and returns the corresponding LaTeX code.

```python
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

model = Pix2Tex()
latex_code = model.image_to_latex(equation_image)
print(f"Generated LaTeX code: {latex_code}")

# Example output:
# Generated LaTeX code: \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
```

Slide 5: Handling Multiple Equations

Pix2TeX can process images containing multiple equations. Let's create a function to handle such cases by splitting the image into individual equations and processing them separately.

```python
import numpy as np
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

def process_multiple_equations(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    equations = split_equations(img)  # Assume we have this function
    
    model = Pix2Tex()
    results = []
    
    for eq in equations:
        latex = model.image_to_latex(eq)
        results.append(latex)
    
    return results

# Usage
latex_equations = process_multiple_equations('multiple_equations.png')
for i, eq in enumerate(latex_equations, 1):
    print(f"Equation {i}: {eq}")
```

Slide 6: Error Handling and Validation

It's important to implement error handling and validation when using Pix2TeX. Let's create a function that checks the input image and handles potential errors during the conversion process.

```python
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
import cv2

def safe_latex_conversion(image_path):
    try:
        img = cv2.imread(image_path)
        if img is None:
            raise ValueError("Invalid image file")
        
        if len(img.shape) == 3:
            img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        model = Pix2Tex()
        latex = model.image_to_latex(img)
        return latex
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return None

# Usage
result = safe_latex_conversion('equation.png')
if result:
    print(f"LaTeX code: {result}")
else:
    print("Conversion failed")
```

Slide 7: Customizing Pix2TeX Output

Pix2TeX allows for some customization of its output. You can adjust parameters such as the confidence threshold and the maximum number of detections. Let's explore how to customize these settings.

```python
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

model = Pix2Tex(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,
    max_detections=5,
    device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
)

image_path = 'complex_equation.png'
latex_code = model.image_to_latex(image_path)
print(f"Customized output: {latex_code}")
```

Slide 8: Integrating Pix2TeX with OCR

For more complex documents, we can combine Pix2TeX with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to process both text and equations. Let's use Tesseract OCR alongside Pix2TeX.

```python
import pytesseract
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
import cv2

def process_document(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # OCR for text
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray)
    
    # Pix2TeX for equations
    model = Pix2Tex()
    equations = model.image_to_latex(gray)
    
    return text, equations

# Usage
text, equations = process_document('document_with_equations.png')
print("Extracted text:", text)
print("Extracted equations:", equations)
```

Slide 9: Batch Processing with Pix2TeX

When dealing with multiple images, batch processing can significantly improve efficiency. Let's create a function to process a directory of images using Pix2TeX.

```python
import os
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
import cv2

def batch_process_equations(directory):
    model = Pix2Tex()
    results = {}
    
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):
            image_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
            latex = model.image_to_latex(img)
            results[filename] = latex
    
    return results

# Usage
equation_directory = './equation_images/'
processed_equations = batch_process_equations(equation_directory)

for filename, latex in processed_equations.items():
    print(f"{filename}: {latex}")
```

Slide 10: Real-life Example: Digitizing Handwritten Notes

Imagine you're a student who has taken handwritten notes during a mathematics lecture. You want to create a digital version of these notes, including all the equations. Here's how you can use Pix2TeX to achieve this.

```python
import cv2
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

def digitize_math_notes(image_path):
    # Load and preprocess the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    _, binary = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    
    # Find contours (potential equations)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    model = Pix2Tex()
    digitized_notes = []
    
    for contour in contours:
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
        roi = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        
        # Convert ROI to LaTeX
        latex = model.image_to_latex(roi)
        digitized_notes.append((x, y, latex))
    
    return digitized_notes

# Usage
notes = digitize_math_notes('handwritten_math_notes.png')
for x, y, latex in notes:
    print(f"Equation at ({x}, {y}): {latex}")
```

Slide 11: Real-life Example: Analyzing Scientific Papers

Researchers often need to extract and analyze equations from scientific papers. Pix2TeX can be a valuable tool in this process. Let's create a simple script to extract equations from a research paper PDF.

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import cv2
import numpy as np
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

def extract_equations_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    model = Pix2Tex()
    equations = []

    for page in doc:
        pix = page.get_pixmap()
        img = np.frombuffer(pix.samples, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(pix.h, pix.w, pix.n)
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)

        # Use image processing to identify potential equation regions
        # This is a simplified example; you might need more sophisticated detection
        _, binary = cv2.threshold(gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
        contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

        for contour in contours:
            x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
            if w > 50 and h > 20:  # Minimum size for an equation
                roi = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
                latex = model.image_to_latex(roi)
                equations.append(latex)

    return equations

# Usage
paper_equations = extract_equations_from_pdf('research_paper.pdf')
for i, eq in enumerate(paper_equations, 1):
    print(f"Equation {i}: {eq}")
```

Slide 12: Improving Accuracy with Image Preprocessing

The accuracy of Pix2TeX can be significantly improved by applying appropriate image preprocessing techniques. Let's explore some advanced preprocessing methods to enhance the quality of input images.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex

def advanced_preprocess(image):
    # Convert to grayscale if not already
    if len(image.shape) == 3:
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    else:
        gray = image

    # Apply adaptive thresholding
    binary = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, 
                                   cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)

    # Noise removal
    kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.uint8)
    opening = cv2.morphologyEx(binary, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel, iterations=2)

    # Edge enhancement
    edges = cv2.Canny(opening, 50, 150, apertureSize=3)
    
    return edges

# Usage with Pix2TeX
model = Pix2Tex()
img = cv2.imread('complex_equation.png')
preprocessed = advanced_preprocess(img)
latex = model.image_to_latex(preprocessed)
print(f"Preprocessed LaTeX: {latex}")

# Display the preprocessed image
cv2.imshow('Preprocessed Image', preprocessed)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Slide 13: Evaluating Pix2TeX Performance

To ensure the reliability of Pix2TeX in your projects, it's crucial to evaluate its performance. Let's create a simple evaluation script that compares Pix2TeX output with ground truth LaTeX code.

```python
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
import cv2
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def evaluate_pix2tex(image_paths, ground_truth):
    model = Pix2Tex()
    scores = []

    for img_path, true_latex in zip(image_paths, ground_truth):
        img = cv2.imread(img_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
        predicted_latex = model.image_to_latex(img)
        
        # Calculate similarity score
        similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, true_latex, predicted_latex).ratio()
        scores.append(similarity)

    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    return average_score

# Example usage
image_paths = ['eq1.png', 'eq2.png', 'eq3.png']
ground_truth = [
    r'\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x',
    r'\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}',
    r'E = mc^2'
]

performance_score = evaluate_pix2tex(image_paths, ground_truth)
print(f"Average performance score: {performance_score:.2f}")
```

Slide 14: Integrating Pix2TeX with LaTeX Editors

To streamline the workflow of converting equations to LaTeX and using them in documents, we can integrate Pix2TeX with popular LaTeX editors. Here's an example of how to create a simple plugin for a hypothetical LaTeX editor.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from pix2tex import Pix2Tex
import pyperclip

class Pix2TeXPlugin:
    def __init__(self, master):
        self.master = master
        self.model = Pix2Tex()
        
        self.button = tk.Button(master, text="Insert Equation", command=self.insert_equation)
        self.button.pack()

    def insert_equation(self):
        file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Image files", "*.png;*.jpg;*.jpeg")])
        if file_path:
            latex = self.model.image_to_latex(file_path)
            pyperclip.(latex)
            print("LaTeX equation copied to clipboard!")

# Usage in a hypothetical LaTeX editor
root = tk.Tk()
plugin = Pix2TeXPlugin(root)
root.mainloop()
```
