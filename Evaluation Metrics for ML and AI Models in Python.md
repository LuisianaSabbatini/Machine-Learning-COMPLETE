## Evaluation Metrics for ML and AI Models in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are crucial for assessing the performance of machine learning and AI models. They provide quantitative measures to compare different models and guide the improvement process. In this presentation, we'll explore various evaluation metrics and how to implement them using Python.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Example predictions and true labels
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1])

# Calculate basic metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")
```

Slide 2: Accuracy

Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases examined. It's suitable for balanced datasets but can be misleading for imbalanced ones.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Output: Accuracy: 0.80
```

Slide 3: Precision

Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. It's particularly useful when the cost of false positives is high.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")

# Output: Precision: 0.75
```

Slide 4: Recall

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified. It's crucial when the cost of false negatives is high.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")

# Output: Recall: 0.86
```

Slide 5: F1 Score

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both metrics. It's particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")

# Output: F1 Score: 0.80
```

Slide 6: Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix provides a tabular summary of a classifier's performance, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: ROC Curve and AUC

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) are used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier across various thresholds.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.3, 0.7, 0.6, 0.2, 0.9, 0.5, 0.8])

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_scores)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.2f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Squared Error is a common metric for regression problems, measuring the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_true = np.array([3, -0.5, 2, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8])

mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")

# Output: Mean Squared Error: 0.375
```

Slide 9: R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)

R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s) in a regression model.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

y_true = np.array([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8, 4.5])

r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.2f}")

# Output: R-squared: 0.97
```

Slide 10: Cross-Entropy Loss

Cross-entropy loss, also known as log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    epsilon = 1e-15
    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.9, 0.2])

loss = cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Cross-Entropy Loss: {loss:.4f}")

# Output: Cross-Entropy Loss: 0.2150
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Spam Detection

In a spam detection system, precision and recall are crucial metrics. High precision ensures that legitimate emails aren't marked as spam, while high recall ensures that most spam is caught.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support

# Simulated results from a spam detection model
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  # 1: spam, 0: not spam
y_pred = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')

print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")

# Output:
# Precision: 0.83
# Recall: 0.83
# F1 Score: 0.83
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

In image classification tasks, such as identifying objects in photographs, accuracy and confusion matrices are commonly used to evaluate model performance.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
import seaborn as sns

# Simulated results from an image classification model
classes = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
y_true = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird']
y_pred = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'cat', 'cat', 'bird']

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, labels=classes)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=classes, yticklabels=classes)
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title(f'Confusion Matrix (Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f})')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Choosing the Right Metric

Selecting the appropriate evaluation metric depends on the specific problem, dataset characteristics, and business objectives. Consider the following factors:

1. Class balance: For imbalanced datasets, prefer metrics like F1 score or AUC over accuracy.
2. Cost of errors: If false positives are more costly, focus on precision; if false negatives are more critical, prioritize recall.
3. Problem type: Use classification metrics for categorical outcomes and regression metrics for continuous outcomes.
4. Interpretability: Some metrics, like accuracy, are easier to explain to non-technical stakeholders.
5. Model comparison: Consistent use of metrics allows for fair comparison between different models.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Generate random predictions and true labels
np.random.seed(42)
y_true = np.random.randint(2, size=1000)
y_pred = np.random.randint(2, size=1000)

# Calculate metrics
metrics = {
    'Accuracy': accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred),
    'Precision': precision_score(y_true, y_pred),
    'Recall': recall_score(y_true, y_pred),
    'F1 Score': f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
}

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(metrics.keys(), metrics.values())
plt.title('Comparison of Different Evaluation Metrics')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
for i, v in enumerate(metrics.values()):
    plt.text(i, v + 0.01, f'{v:.2f}', ha='center')
plt.show()
```
