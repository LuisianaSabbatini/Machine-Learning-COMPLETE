## Fundamental Python Concepts

Slide 1: Introduction to Python 

Welcome to Python
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, and more.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Slide 2: Variables and Data Types 

Storing and Manipulating Data
Python supports various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Variables are used to store and manipulate data.

```python
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25  # Integer
height = 1.68  # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

Slide 3: Operators and Expressions
Performing Calculations and Operations
Python provides a range of operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, etc.) to perform calculations and manipulate data.

```python
x = 10
y = 3
sum = x + y  # Addition: 13
diff = x - y  # Subtraction: 7
prod = x * y  # Multiplication: 30
div = x / y  # Division: 3.3333333333333335
mod = x % y  # Modulus: 1
```

Slide 4: Control Flow (Conditionals)
Making Decisions with Conditionals
Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

Slide 5: Control Flow (Loops)
Repeating Tasks with Loops
Loops enable you to execute a block of code repeatedly, either a specific number of times (for loop) or until a certain condition is met (while loop).

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

Slide 6: Functions
Modularizing Code with Functions
Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable code blocks and enhance code organization and readability.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

Slide 7: Lists
Working with Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of different data types. They are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
fruits.append("grape")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
```

Slide 8: Tuples
Working with Tuples
Tuples are ordered collections of items, similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation.

```python
point = (3, 4)
print(point[0])  # Output: 3
# point[0] = 5  # This will raise an error (tuples are immutable)
```

Slide 9: Dictionaries
Working with Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers).

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
person["age"] = 26
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'New York'}
```

Slide 10: File Operations
Reading and Writing Files
Python provides built-in functions to read from and write to files, which is essential for working with data and persisting information.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

Slide 11: Modules and Packages
Reusing and Organizing Code
Modules and packages allow you to organize and reuse code across different parts of your application, promoting code modularization and maintainability.

```python
# Import a module
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)  # Using a function from the math module
print(result)  # Output: 4.0
```

Slide 12: Exception Handling
Handling Errors Gracefully
Exception handling allows you to catch and handle errors that occur during program execution, preventing crashes and ensuring graceful error handling.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(result)
```

Slide 13: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Introducing Object-Oriented Programming
OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says: Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Labrador")
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says: Woof!
```
