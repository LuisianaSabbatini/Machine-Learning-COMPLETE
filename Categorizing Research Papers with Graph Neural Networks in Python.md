## Categorizing Research Papers with Graph Neural Networks in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Graph Neural Networks for Research Paper Categorization

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and categorizing research papers. By representing papers and their relationships as nodes and edges in a graph, GNNs can capture complex patterns and dependencies, leading to more accurate categorization.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple graph representing research papers
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([('Paper A', 'Paper B'), ('Paper B', 'Paper C'), ('Paper C', 'Paper D')])

# Visualize the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=1500, font_size=10)
plt.title("Simple Research Paper Graph")
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Graph Representation of Research Papers

In our graph, nodes represent individual research papers, while edges represent relationships between papers, such as citations or shared topics. This representation allows us to capture the intricate connections within the academic landscape.

```python
import networkx as nx
import random

def create_paper_graph(num_papers, num_edges):
    G = nx.Graph()
    papers = [f"Paper_{i}" for i in range(num_papers)]
    G.add_nodes_from(papers)
    
    for _ in range(num_edges):
        paper1, paper2 = random.sample(papers, 2)
        G.add_edge(paper1, paper2)
    
    return G

paper_graph = create_paper_graph(10, 15)
print(f"Number of nodes: {paper_graph.number_of_nodes()}")
print(f"Number of edges: {paper_graph.number_of_edges()}")
```

Slide 3: Node Features in Research Paper Graphs

Each node in our graph contains features that describe the research paper. These features can include the paper's title, abstract, keywords, authors, and publication year. We'll create a simple feature vector for each paper node.

```python
import numpy as np

def generate_paper_features(num_papers, feature_dim):
    return {f"Paper_{i}": np.random.rand(feature_dim) for i in range(num_papers)}

num_papers = 10
feature_dim = 5
paper_features = generate_paper_features(num_papers, feature_dim)

print("Feature vector for Paper_0:")
print(paper_features["Paper_0"])
```

Slide 4: Graph Neural Network Architecture

A typical GNN architecture for paper categorization consists of multiple graph convolutional layers followed by a classification layer. Each layer aggregates information from neighboring nodes, allowing the model to capture both local and global graph structure.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch_geometric.nn as geo_nn

class PaperGNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(PaperGNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = geo_nn.GCNConv(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = geo_nn.GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        h = torch.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        h = torch.relu(self.conv2(h, edge_index))
        return self.classifier(h)

# Example usage
input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim = 5, 16, 3
model = PaperGNN(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)
print(model)
```

Slide 5: Data Preparation for GNN

Before training our GNN, we need to prepare our data in a format suitable for graph-based learning. This involves creating an adjacency matrix and a feature matrix from our paper graph and node features.

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def prepare_gnn_data(graph, features):
    # Create adjacency matrix
    adj_matrix = nx.adjacency_matrix(graph)
    
    # Create feature matrix
    feature_matrix = np.array([features[node] for node in graph.nodes()])
    
    # Convert to PyTorch tensors
    adj_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(adj_matrix.todense())
    feature_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(feature_matrix)
    
    return adj_tensor, feature_tensor

# Example usage
adj, features = prepare_gnn_data(paper_graph, paper_features)
print("Adjacency matrix shape:", adj.shape)
print("Feature matrix shape:", features.shape)
```

Slide 6: Training the Graph Neural Network

Now that we have our data prepared, we can train our GNN model. We'll use a simple training loop with backpropagation to optimize our model's parameters.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

def train_gnn(model, adj, features, labels, epochs=100):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        output = model(features, adj)
        loss = criterion(output, labels)
        
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

# Example usage (assuming we have labels)
num_classes = 3
labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (num_papers,))
train_gnn(model, adj, features, labels)
```

Slide 7: Paper Categorization with Trained GNN

After training our GNN, we can use it to categorize new research papers. We'll demonstrate this process by categorizing a sample paper using our trained model.

```python
def categorize_paper(model, graph, features, new_paper_features):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        adj, feature_matrix = prepare_gnn_data(graph, features)
        new_features = torch.cat([feature_matrix, new_paper_features.unsqueeze(0)])
        new_adj = torch.zeros(adj.shape[0] + 1, adj.shape[1] + 1)
        new_adj[:adj.shape[0], :adj.shape[1]] = adj
        output = model(new_features, new_adj)
        category = torch.argmax(output[-1]).item()
    return category

# Example usage
new_paper = torch.rand(feature_dim)
category = categorize_paper(model, paper_graph, paper_features, new_paper)
print(f"The new paper belongs to category: {category}")
```

Slide 8: Handling Large-Scale Paper Graphs

When dealing with large-scale paper graphs, we need to use efficient techniques to process and analyze the data. One approach is to use graph sampling methods to reduce the computational complexity.

```python
import networkx as nx
import random

def sample_subgraph(graph, sample_size):
    nodes = list(graph.nodes())
    sampled_nodes = random.sample(nodes, min(sample_size, len(nodes)))
    return graph.subgraph(sampled_nodes)

# Example usage
large_graph = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(1000, 0.01)
sampled_graph = sample_subgraph(large_graph, 100)

print(f"Original graph size: {large_graph.number_of_nodes()}")
print(f"Sampled graph size: {sampled_graph.number_of_nodes()}")
```

Slide 9: Feature Engineering for Research Papers

Feature engineering is crucial for effective paper categorization. We'll create a simple function to extract features from paper titles using TF-IDF vectorization.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def extract_paper_features(titles, max_features=100):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=max_features)
    features = vectorizer.fit_transform(titles)
    return features.toarray(), vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Example usage
paper_titles = [
    "Graph Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing",
    "Advances in Deep Learning for Computer Vision",
    "Reinforcement Learning in Robotics: A Survey"
]

features, feature_names = extract_paper_features(paper_titles)
print("Feature names:", feature_names[:5])
print("Feature vector for the first paper:", features[0][:5])
```

Slide 10: Visualizing Paper Categories

After categorizing papers, it's helpful to visualize the results. We'll create a function to plot papers in a 2D space using t-SNE dimensionality reduction.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_paper_categories(features, categories):
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
    embeddings = tsne.fit_transform(features)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    scatter = plt.scatter(embeddings[:, 0], embeddings[:, 1], c=categories, cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(scatter)
    plt.title("t-SNE Visualization of Paper Categories")
    plt.xlabel("t-SNE 1")
    plt.ylabel("t-SNE 2")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
num_papers = 100
num_categories = 5
features = np.random.rand(num_papers, 50)
categories = np.random.randint(0, num_categories, num_papers)

visualize_paper_categories(features, categories)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Categorizing Computer Science Papers

Let's apply our GNN-based categorization to a real-life scenario of categorizing computer science papers into subfields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

```python
import networkx as nx
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Create a sample graph of CS papers
cs_papers = nx.Graph()
cs_papers.add_edges_from([
    ("ML1", "ML2"), ("ML2", "ML3"), ("ML3", "ML1"),
    ("CV1", "CV2"), ("CV2", "CV3"), ("CV3", "CV1"),
    ("NLP1", "NLP2"), ("NLP2", "NLP3"), ("NLP3", "NLP1"),
    ("ML1", "CV1"), ("CV2", "NLP2")
])

# Assign features (simplified for demonstration)
features = {node: torch.randn(10) for node in cs_papers.nodes()}

# Train a GNN (simplified)
model = PaperGNN(10, 16, 3)  # 3 categories: ML, CV, NLP
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    adj = torch.tensor(nx.adjacency_matrix(cs_papers).todense()).float()
    x = torch.stack([features[node] for node in cs_papers.nodes()])
    
    output = model(x, adj)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(output, torch.randint(0, 3, (len(cs_papers),)))
    
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Training complete. Model ready for categorization.")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Categorizing Bioinformatics Papers

Now, let's look at another real-life example where we categorize bioinformatics papers into subfields such as Genomics, Proteomics, and Systems Biology.

```python
import networkx as nx
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import random

# Create a sample graph of bioinformatics papers
bio_papers = nx.Graph()
bio_papers.add_edges_from([
    ("GEN1", "GEN2"), ("GEN2", "GEN3"), ("GEN3", "GEN1"),
    ("PRO1", "PRO2"), ("PRO2", "PRO3"), ("PRO3", "PRO1"),
    ("SYS1", "SYS2"), ("SYS2", "SYS3"), ("SYS3", "SYS1"),
    ("GEN1", "PRO1"), ("PRO2", "SYS2")
])

# Assign features (simplified for demonstration)
features = {node: torch.randn(10) for node in bio_papers.nodes()}

# Train a GNN (simplified)
model = PaperGNN(10, 16, 3)  # 3 categories: Genomics, Proteomics, Systems Biology
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    adj = torch.tensor(nx.adjacency_matrix(bio_papers).todense()).float()
    x = torch.stack([features[node] for node in bio_papers.nodes()])
    
    output = model(x, adj)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(output, torch.randint(0, 3, (len(bio_papers),)))
    
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Categorize a new paper
new_paper_features = torch.randn(10)
new_paper_category = torch.argmax(model(new_paper_features.unsqueeze(0), torch.zeros(1, 1))).item()
categories = ["Genomics", "Proteomics", "Systems Biology"]
print(f"The new bioinformatics paper is categorized as: {categories[new_paper_category]}")
```

Slide 13: Evaluating GNN Performance

To assess the effectiveness of our GNN model in categorizing research papers, we need to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. We'll implement functions to calculate accuracy and F1 score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
import torch

def evaluate_gnn(model, adj, features, true_labels):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(features, adj)
        predicted_labels = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
        
        accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)
        f1 = f1_score(true_labels, predicted_labels, average='weighted')
        
    return accuracy, f1

# Example usage
true_labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (num_papers,))
accuracy, f1 = evaluate_gnn(model, adj, features, true_labels)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
```

Slide 14: Handling Dynamic Paper Graphs

Research paper networks are dynamic, with new papers being published regularly. We need to adapt our GNN model to handle these changes efficiently. Here's a simple approach to update our graph and retrain the model incrementally.

```python
import networkx as nx
import torch

def update_paper_graph(graph, new_papers, new_connections):
    graph.add_nodes_from(new_papers)
    graph.add_edges_from(new_connections)
    return graph

def retrain_gnn(model, graph, features, labels, epochs=10):
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        adj = torch.tensor(nx.adjacency_matrix(graph).todense()).float()
        x = torch.stack([features[node] for node in graph.nodes()])
        
        output = model(x, adj)
        loss = criterion(output, labels)
        
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Model retrained for {epochs} epochs")

# Example usage
new_papers = ["New_Paper_1", "New_Paper_2"]
new_connections = [("New_Paper_1", "Paper_0"), ("New_Paper_2", "Paper_1")]
updated_graph = update_paper_graph(paper_graph, new_papers, new_connections)

# Update features and labels for new papers
for paper in new_papers:
    paper_features[paper] = torch.rand(feature_dim)

new_labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (len(updated_graph),))
retrain_gnn(model, updated_graph, paper_features, new_labels)
```

Slide 15: Conclusion and Future Directions

Graph Neural Networks have shown great potential in categorizing research papers by leveraging the complex relationships between papers. As we've seen, GNNs can capture both the content and the network structure of research papers, leading to more accurate categorization.

Future directions for improving this approach include:

1. Incorporating more sophisticated node features, such as paper abstracts or full text analysis.
2. Exploring different GNN architectures, such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) or GraphSAGE.
3. Developing methods for handling very large-scale paper networks efficiently.
4. Integrating temporal information to capture the evolution of research topics over time.

By continuing to advance these techniques, we can create more powerful tools for organizing and understanding the vast landscape of scientific literature.
