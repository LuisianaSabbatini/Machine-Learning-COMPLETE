## Introduction to Confusion Matrices in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Confusion Matrices

Confusion matrices are a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of a classification model. They provide a comprehensive view of how well the model is classifying instances by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
```

Slide 2: Creating a Confusion Matrix

To create a confusion matrix using scikit-learn, we can use the `confusion_matrix` function from the `metrics` module. It takes the true labels and the predicted labels as input.

```python
y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
```

Slide 3: Understanding the Confusion Matrix Structure

A confusion matrix is a square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of classes in the dataset. The rows represent the actual classes, and the columns represent the predicted classes.

```python
[[3 1]
 [1 2]]
```

Slide 4: Interpreting the Confusion Matrix

The diagonal elements of the confusion matrix represent the correctly classified instances, while the off-diagonal elements represent the misclassified instances.

```python
true_positives = conf_matrix[0, 0]
false_positives = conf_matrix[0, 1]
false_negatives = conf_matrix[1, 0]
true_negatives = conf_matrix[1, 1]
```

Slide 5: Calculating Accuracy

The accuracy of a classification model can be calculated from the confusion matrix by summing the true positives and true negatives, and dividing by the total number of instances.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 6: Visualizing Confusion Matrices with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a popular Python library for data visualization. It can be used to create visual representations of confusion matrices.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.matshow(conf_matrix, cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Improving Confusion Matrix Visualization

To enhance the visual representation of the confusion matrix, we can add labels, titles, and color maps.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class_names = ['Negative', 'Positive']
conf_matrix = conf_matrix.astype('float') / conf_matrix.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]

plt.imshow(conf_matrix, interpolation='nearest', cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.colorbar()
tick_marks = np.arange(len(class_names))
plt.xticks(tick_marks, class_names, rotation=45)
plt.yticks(tick_marks, class_names)
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Normalized Confusion Matrix

To better interpret the confusion matrix, we can normalize it by dividing each element by the sum of its row, representing the true class proportions.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, normalize='true')
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=conf_matrix)
disp.plot()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Precision, recall, and F1-score are important metrics derived from the confusion matrix. They provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a classification model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1-Score: {f1:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Multi-Class Confusion Matrices

Confusion matrices can be extended to handle multi-class classification problems. The matrix dimensions increase to accommodate the additional classes.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
```

Slide 11: Visualizing Multi-Class Confusion Matrices

Visualizing multi-class confusion matrices can be challenging due to the increased complexity. Scikit-learn provides a convenient function for this purpose.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test)
disp.ax_.set_title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Imbalanced Datasets and Confusion Matrices

Confusion matrices can be particularly useful when working with imbalanced datasets, where one class is significantly underrepresented compared to others.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=2, n_features=2, cluster_std=2, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
```

Slide 13: Handling Imbalanced Datasets

Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models that favor the majority class. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights can help mitigate this issue.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

over_sampler = RandomOverSampler(sampling_strategy='minority')
under_sampler = RandomUnderSampler(sampling_strategy='majority')

X_resampled, y_resampled = over_sampler.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
X_resampled, y_resampled = under_sampler.fit_resample(X_resampled, y_resampled)

model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
```

Slide 14: Conclusion
