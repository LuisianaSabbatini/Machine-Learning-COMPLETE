## Auto-Document Retrieval for Improved RAG Systems
Slide 1: Auto-Document Retrieval: The Future of RAG

Auto-Document Retrieval is an advanced technique that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It autonomously selects and retrieves relevant documents from large datasets, improving the quality and relevance of generated content. This approach combines the power of machine learning with efficient information retrieval methods to create more accurate and context-aware AI-generated responses.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def auto_document_retrieval(query, documents):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    document_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
    query_vector = vectorizer.transform([query])
    
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, document_vectors)
    most_relevant_doc_index = np.argmax(similarities)
    
    return documents[most_relevant_doc_index]

# Example usage
documents = [
    "Auto-Document Retrieval enhances RAG systems.",
    "Machine learning improves information retrieval.",
    "Python is a versatile programming language."
]
query = "How does Auto-Document Retrieval work?"

relevant_doc = auto_document_retrieval(query, documents)
print(f"Most relevant document: {relevant_doc}")
```

Slide 2: Understanding RAG Systems

RAG systems combine pre-trained language models with external knowledge bases to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Auto-Document Retrieval takes this a step further by automating the process of selecting the most pertinent information from the knowledge base, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

def rag_system(query, retrieved_document):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
    
    context = f"Context: {retrieved_document}\nQuery: {query}\nAnswer:"
    inputs = tokenizer(context, return_tensors="pt")
    
    output = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)
    response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    return response

# Example usage
query = "How does Auto-Document Retrieval enhance RAG systems?"
retrieved_document = "Auto-Document Retrieval enhances RAG systems by automatically selecting relevant information."

response = rag_system(query, retrieved_document)
print(f"Generated response: {response}")
```

Slide 3: Vector Embeddings in Auto-Document Retrieval

Vector embeddings are crucial in Auto-Document Retrieval systems. They transform text into numerical representations, allowing for efficient similarity comparisons between queries and documents. These embeddings capture semantic meanings, enabling the system to understand context and nuances in language.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

def create_embeddings(texts):
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = model.encode(texts)
    return embeddings

# Example usage
texts = [
    "Auto-Document Retrieval uses vector embeddings.",
    "Vector embeddings capture semantic meanings.",
    "Embeddings enable efficient similarity comparisons."
]

embeddings = create_embeddings(texts)
print(f"Shape of embeddings: {embeddings.shape}")
print(f"First embedding: {embeddings[0][:5]}...")  # Showing first 5 values
```

Slide 4: Similarity Measures in Auto-Document Retrieval

Similarity measures are essential for determining the relevance of documents to a given query. Cosine similarity is a popular choice due to its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a normalized similarity score.

```python
import numpy as np

def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
    norm1 = np.linalg.norm(vec1)
    norm2 = np.linalg.norm(vec2)
    return dot_product / (norm1 * norm2)

# Example usage
vec1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vec2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)
print(f"Cosine similarity: {similarity:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Indexing for Efficient Retrieval

Efficient indexing is crucial for fast retrieval in large document collections. Techniques like inverted indexing and approximate nearest neighbor search can significantly speed up the retrieval process. These methods allow for quick identification of relevant documents without exhaustive searches.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def create_inverted_index(documents):
    inverted_index = defaultdict(list)
    for doc_id, doc in enumerate(documents):
        for word in doc.split():
            inverted_index[word].append(doc_id)
    return inverted_index

def search(query, inverted_index, documents):
    query_words = query.split()
    doc_ids = set.intersection(*[set(inverted_index[word]) for word in query_words])
    return [documents[doc_id] for doc_id in doc_ids]

# Example usage
documents = [
    "Auto-Document Retrieval enhances search efficiency",
    "Inverted indexing speeds up document retrieval",
    "Efficient indexing is crucial for large document collections"
]

inverted_index = create_inverted_index(documents)
query = "indexing document retrieval"
results = search(query, inverted_index, documents)

print(f"Search results: {results}")
```

Slide 6: Query Expansion in Auto-Document Retrieval

Query expansion enhances retrieval by adding related terms to the original query. This technique helps capture relevant documents that may not contain the exact query terms but are semantically related. It improves recall and addresses vocabulary mismatch issues.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

nltk.download('wordnet')

def expand_query(query):
    expanded_terms = []
    for word in query.split():
        synsets = wordnet.synsets(word)
        for syn in synsets:
            for lemma in syn.lemmas():
                expanded_terms.append(lemma.name())
    return list(set(expanded_terms))

# Example usage
original_query = "car repair"
expanded_query = expand_query(original_query)

print(f"Original query: {original_query}")
print(f"Expanded query: {', '.join(expanded_query)}")
```

Slide 7: Ranking in Auto-Document Retrieval

Document ranking is crucial in Auto-Document Retrieval to present the most relevant results first. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a common ranking method that balances the importance of terms within a document and across the entire corpus.

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def compute_tf_idf(documents):
    word_doc_freq = Counter()
    doc_word_count = []
    
    for doc in documents:
        words = doc.split()
        word_doc_freq.update(set(words))
        doc_word_count.append(Counter(words))
    
    idf = {word: math.log(len(documents) / freq) for word, freq in word_doc_freq.items()}
    
    tf_idf = []
    for doc_counts in doc_word_count:
        doc_tf_idf = {word: count * idf[word] for word, count in doc_counts.items()}
        tf_idf.append(doc_tf_idf)
    
    return tf_idf

# Example usage
documents = [
    "Auto-Document Retrieval enhances search efficiency",
    "TF-IDF is used for document ranking",
    "Ranking improves result relevance in retrieval systems"
]

tf_idf_scores = compute_tf_idf(documents)
print(f"TF-IDF scores for the first document: {tf_idf_scores[0]}")
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Content Recommendation System

Auto-Document Retrieval can power content recommendation systems, enhancing user experience by suggesting relevant articles or products. This example demonstrates a basic recommendation system for a news website.

```python
import random

class ContentRecommender:
    def __init__(self, articles):
        self.articles = articles
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        self.article_vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform([article['content'] for article in articles])
    
    def recommend(self, user_interests, n=3):
        user_vector = self.vectorizer.transform([user_interests])
        similarities = cosine_similarity(user_vector, self.article_vectors)[0]
        top_indices = similarities.argsort()[-n:][::-1]
        return [self.articles[i] for i in top_indices]

# Example usage
articles = [
    {"title": "Latest Developments in AI", "content": "Artificial Intelligence is advancing rapidly..."},
    {"title": "Climate Change Effects", "content": "Global warming is causing significant environmental changes..."},
    {"title": "Space Exploration Update", "content": "NASA announces new missions to explore Mars..."},
    {"title": "Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing", "content": "Scientists achieve quantum supremacy..."},
    {"title": "The Future of Electric Vehicles", "content": "Electric car market is expanding globally..."}
]

recommender = ContentRecommender(articles)
user_interests = "AI and quantum computing advancements"
recommendations = recommender.recommend(user_interests)

print("Recommended articles:")
for article in recommendations:
    print(f"- {article['title']}")
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Automated Customer Support

Auto-Document Retrieval can significantly improve automated customer support systems by quickly finding relevant information from a knowledge base to answer customer queries.

```python
class CustomerSupportBot:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        self.kb_vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform([item['content'] for item in knowledge_base])
    
    def answer_query(self, query):
        query_vector = self.vectorizer.transform([query])
        similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, self.kb_vectors)[0]
        most_relevant_index = similarities.argmax()
        return self.knowledge_base[most_relevant_index]['answer']

# Example usage
knowledge_base = [
    {"content": "How to reset password", "answer": "To reset your password, go to the login page and click 'Forgot Password'."},
    {"content": "Return policy for items", "answer": "You can return items within 30 days of purchase with a valid receipt."},
    {"content": "Shipping times and costs", "answer": "Standard shipping takes 3-5 business days and costs $5.99."},
    {"content": "Product warranty information", "answer": "All electronic products come with a 1-year limited warranty."}
]

support_bot = CustomerSupportBot(knowledge_base)

query = "How long does shipping take?"
answer = support_bot.answer_query(query)

print(f"Customer: {query}")
print(f"Bot: {answer}")
```

Slide 10: Challenges in Auto-Document Retrieval

While Auto-Document Retrieval offers significant benefits, it also faces challenges such as handling ambiguous queries, maintaining up-to-date information, and dealing with large-scale data. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the effectiveness of RAG systems.

```python
import datetime

class DocumentManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.documents = []
    
    def add_document(self, content, expiry_date=None):
        self.documents.append({
            'content': content,
            'added_date': datetime.datetime.now(),
            'expiry_date': expiry_date
        })
    
    def remove_expired_documents(self):
        current_date = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.documents = [doc for doc in self.documents if not doc['expiry_date'] or doc['expiry_date'] > current_date]
    
    def handle_ambiguous_query(self, query):
        # Simplified method to handle ambiguous queries
        potential_matches = [doc for doc in self.documents if any(word in doc['content'] for word in query.split())]
        return f"Found {len(potential_matches)} potential matches. Please provide more specific information."

# Example usage
manager = DocumentManager()
manager.add_document("Python programming basics", datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30))
manager.add_document("Advanced Python techniques", datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=60))

ambiguous_query = "Python"
result = manager.handle_ambiguous_query(ambiguous_query)
print(result)

manager.remove_expired_documents()
print(f"Number of documents after removal: {len(manager.documents)}")
```

Slide 11: Evaluation Metrics for Auto-Document Retrieval

Evaluating the performance of Auto-Document Retrieval systems is crucial for continuous improvement. Common metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and completeness of the retrieval results.

```python
def calculate_metrics(relevant_docs, retrieved_docs):
    true_positives = len(set(relevant_docs) & set(retrieved_docs))
    precision = true_positives / len(retrieved_docs) if retrieved_docs else 0
    recall = true_positives / len(relevant_docs) if relevant_docs else 0
    f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if precision + recall else 0
    
    return precision, recall, f1_score

# Example usage
relevant_docs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
retrieved_docs = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]

precision, recall, f1_score = calculate_metrics(relevant_docs, retrieved_docs)

print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1-score: {f1_score:.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Future Directions in Auto-Document Retrieval

The future of Auto-Document Retrieval lies in leveraging advanced AI techniques such as few-shot learning and zero-shot learning. These approaches can enhance the system's ability to understand and retrieve relevant information from diverse and previously unseen document types.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def zero_shot_classification(text, candidate_labels):
    classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
    result = classifier(text, candidate_labels)
    return result

# Example usage
text = "The new electric car model has impressive range and acceleration."
candidate_labels = ["Technology", "Environment", "Sports"]

result = zero_shot_classification(text, candidate_labels)

print("Zero-shot classification results:")
for label, score in zip(result['labels'], result['scores']):
    print(f"{label}: {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 13: Ethical Considerations in Auto-Document Retrieval

As Auto-Document Retrieval systems become more sophisticated, it's crucial to address ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and transparency. Implementing safeguards and regular audits can help ensure these systems are used responsibly and fairly.

```python
import re

def remove_personal_info(text):
    # Remove email addresses
    text = re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[EMAIL REDACTED]', text)
    
    # Remove phone numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b', '[PHONE REDACTED]', text)
    
    # Remove names (simplified approach)
    text = re.sub(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b', '[NAME REDACTED]', text)
    
    return text

def audit_retrieval_results(query, results):
    sensitive_terms = ['gender', 'race', 'religion', 'nationality']
    warnings = []
    
    for term in sensitive_terms:
        if term in query.lower():
            warnings.append(f"Query contains potentially sensitive term: {term}")
    
    for result in results:
        if any(term in result.lower() for term in sensitive_terms):
            warnings.append(f"Result contains potentially sensitive content")
            break
    
    return warnings

# Example usage
query = "Impact of gender on job opportunities"
results = [
    "Research shows gender disparities in certain industries",
    "Recent initiatives aim to promote workplace diversity"
]

warnings = audit_retrieval_results(query, results)
for warning in warnings:
    print(f"Warning: {warning}")

sensitive_text = "John Doe's email is john@example.com and phone is 123-456-7890"
redacted_text = remove_personal_info(sensitive_text)
print(f"Redacted text: {redacted_text}")
```

Slide 14: Integration with Natural Language Processing

Auto-Document Retrieval systems can be enhanced by integrating advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. These techniques improve understanding of user queries and document content, leading to more accurate retrievals.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)[0]
    return result['label'], result['score']

def extract_entities(text):
    ner = pipeline("ner")
    entities = ner(text)
    return [entity for entity in entities if entity['entity'] != 'O']

# Example usage
query = "What are the environmental impacts of electric cars?"

sentiment, confidence = analyze_sentiment(query)
print(f"Query sentiment: {sentiment} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})")

entities = extract_entities(query)
print("Extracted entities:")
for entity in entities:
    print(f"- {entity['word']}: {entity['entity']}")

# This information can be used to refine the document retrieval process
```

Slide 15: Scalability and Performance Optimization

As document collections grow, optimizing the performance and scalability of Auto-Document Retrieval systems becomes crucial. Techniques such as distributed computing and caching can significantly improve response times and handle larger datasets.

```python
import hashlib
from functools import lru_cache

class ScalableRetriever:
    def __init__(self, documents):
        self.documents = documents
        self.index = self._build_index()
    
    def _build_index(self):
        index = {}
        for i, doc in enumerate(self.documents):
            for word in set(doc.split()):
                if word not in index:
                    index[word] = []
                index[word].append(i)
        return index
    
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    def _cache_key(self, query):
        return hashlib.md5(query.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def retrieve(self, query):
        cache_key = self._cache_key(query)
        words = query.split()
        doc_indices = set.intersection(*[set(self.index.get(word, [])) for word in words])
        return [self.documents[i] for i in doc_indices]

# Example usage
documents = [
    "Auto-Document Retrieval enhances search efficiency",
    "Scalability is crucial for large document collections",
    "Caching improves response times in retrieval systems"
]

retriever = ScalableRetriever(documents)
query = "document retrieval efficiency"
results = retriever.retrieve(query)

print("Retrieved documents:")
for doc in results:
    print(f"- {doc}")
```
