## Mastering Python Loops with the `continue` Statement
Slide 1: The Power of the `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement is a powerful tool in Python loops that allows you to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one. It provides fine-grained control over loop execution, enabling you to bypass certain conditions or elements without breaking the entire loop.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 3
# 4
```

Slide 2: Basic Syntax and Usage

The `continue` statement is simple to use. When encountered, it immediately jumps to the next iteration of the loop. This is particularly useful when you want to skip specific elements or conditions within your loop.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "cherry":
        continue
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Output:
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like date
# I like elderberry
```

Slide 3: Enhancing Readability with `continue`

Using `continue` can make your code more readable by reducing nested conditionals. Instead of wrapping a large block of code in an `if` statement, you can use `continue` to skip unwanted cases early.

```python
# Without continue
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
        # More code here...

# With continue
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue
    print(f"{num} is even")
    # More code here...
```

Slide 4: `continue` in Nested Loops

The `continue` statement affects only the innermost loop it appears in. In nested loops, it skips to the next iteration of the immediate enclosing loop.

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if i == j:
            continue
        print(f"({i}, {j})")

# Output:
# (0, 1)
# (0, 2)
# (1, 0)
# (1, 2)
# (2, 0)
# (2, 1)
```

Slide 5: Combining `continue` with `while` Loops

The `continue` statement works seamlessly with `while` loops, allowing you to skip iterations based on specific conditions.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue
    print(f"Count is {count}")

# Output:
# Count is 1
# Count is 2
# Count is 4
# Count is 5
```

Slide 6: Real-Life Example: Data Cleaning

In data processing, `continue` is often used to skip invalid or unwanted data points. Here's an example of filtering out negative values from a dataset:

```python
temperatures = [23, -5, 19, 35, -2, 28, 40, -10]
valid_temps = []

for temp in temperatures:
    if temp < 0:
        continue
    valid_temps.append(temp)

print(f"Valid temperatures: {valid_temps}")

# Output:
# Valid temperatures: [23, 19, 35, 28, 40]
```

Slide 7: Optimizing Loops with `continue`

Using `continue` can help optimize loops by skipping unnecessary computations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where early checks can save processing time.

```python
import time

def process_data(data):
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulating a time-consuming operation
    return data * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

start_time = time.time()
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue
    result = process_data(num)
    print(f"Processed: {result}")

print(f"Execution time: {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")

# Output:
# Processed: 4
# Processed: 8
# Processed: 12
# Processed: 16
# Processed: 20
# Execution time: 0.51 seconds
```

Slide 8: Handling Exceptions with `continue`

The `continue` statement can be used within a try-except block to skip iterations that raise exceptions, allowing the loop to proceed with the next iteration.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 0, 7, 8]

for num in numbers:
    try:
        result = 10 / num
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print(f"Skipping division by zero")
        continue
    print(f"10 divided by {num} is {result}")

# Output:
# 10 divided by 1 is 10.0
# 10 divided by 2 is 5.0
# Skipping division by zero
# 10 divided by 4 is 2.5
# 10 divided by 5 is 2.0
# Skipping division by zero
# 10 divided by 7 is 1.4285714285714286
# 10 divided by 8 is 1.25
```

Slide 9: `continue` in List Comprehensions

While `continue` cannot be directly used in list comprehensions, you can achieve similar functionality using conditional statements.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Using a regular for loop with continue
even_squares = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue
    even_squares.append(num ** 2)

print(f"Even squares (loop): {even_squares}")

# Equivalent list comprehension
even_squares_comp = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(f"Even squares (comprehension): {even_squares_comp}")

# Output:
# Even squares (loop): [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
# Even squares (comprehension): [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Log Parser

Here's an example of using `continue` to parse a log file, skipping lines that don't match a specific format:

```python
log_lines = [
    "2023-09-01 10:15:30 INFO User logged in",
    "Invalid log line",
    "2023-09-01 10:16:45 ERROR Database connection failed",
    "Another invalid line",
    "2023-09-01 10:17:20 WARNING High CPU usage detected"
]

for line in log_lines:
    parts = line.split(maxsplit=3)
    if len(parts) != 4:
        print(f"Skipping invalid log line: {line}")
        continue
    date, time, level, message = parts
    print(f"Log Entry - Date: {date}, Time: {time}, Level: {level}, Message: {message}")

# Output:
# Log Entry - Date: 2023-09-01, Time: 10:15:30, Level: INFO, Message: User logged in
# Skipping invalid log line: Invalid log line
# Log Entry - Date: 2023-09-01, Time: 10:16:45, Level: ERROR, Message: Database connection failed
# Skipping invalid log line: Another invalid line
# Log Entry - Date: 2023-09-01, Time: 10:17:20, Level: WARNING, Message: High CPU usage detected
```

Slide 11: Combining `continue` with `else` in Loops

Python allows the use of an `else` clause with loops. The `else` block is executed when the loop completes normally, without encountering a `break` statement. The `continue` statement doesn't affect the `else` clause.

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop completed successfully")

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 4
# Loop completed successfully
```

Slide 12: Common Pitfalls: Infinite Loops

Be cautious when using `continue` in `while` loops. Ensure that the loop's condition is eventually met to avoid infinite loops.

```python
# Potential infinite loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    if count == 3:
        continue  # This will cause an infinite loop when count is 3
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Correct usage
count = 0
while count < 5:
    if count == 3:
        count += 1
        continue
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 4
```

Slide 13: Performance Considerations

While `continue` is a powerful tool, it's important to consider its impact on performance, especially in tight loops. In some cases, restructuring the loop might be more efficient than using `continue`.

```python
import timeit

def with_continue():
    result = 0
    for i in range(1000000):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            continue
        result += i
    return result

def without_continue():
    return sum(i for i in range(1000000) if i % 2 != 0)

print(f"Time with continue: {timeit.timeit(with_continue, number=10):.4f} seconds")
print(f"Time without continue: {timeit.timeit(without_continue, number=10):.4f} seconds")

# Output may vary depending on the system:
# Time with continue: 0.5123 seconds
# Time without continue: 0.3456 seconds
```

Slide 14: Best Practices and Conclusion
