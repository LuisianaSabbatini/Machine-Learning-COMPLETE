## Major Forms of Machine Learning
Slide 1: Introduction to Major Forms of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a rapidly evolving field with various approaches to teaching computers how to learn from data. This presentation covers eight major forms of learning in ML, each with its unique characteristics and applications.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

forms = ['Supervised', 'Unsupervised', 'Semi-supervised', 'Transfer',
         'Online', 'Reinforcement', 'Incremental', 'Deep']
sizes = [25, 20, 15, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5]
colors = plt.cm.Spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, len(forms)))

plt.pie(sizes, labels=forms, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.axis('equal')
plt.title('Major Forms of Machine Learning')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where both input features and corresponding target variables are provided. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, enabling it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}")
```

Slide 3: Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns or structures in unlabeled data. It aims to discover hidden relationships or groupings within the dataset without predefined target variables.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(300, 2)

# Perform K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], 
            marker='x', s=200, linewidths=3, color='r')
plt.title('K-means Clustering')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Semi-supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data to improve model performance, especially when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

```python
from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelSpreading
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = np.zeros(100)
y[:10] = 1  # Label only 10 samples

# Create mask for unlabeled data
unlabeled_mask = np.ones(len(X), dtype=bool)
unlabeled_mask[:10] = False

# Train a label spreading model
model = LabelSpreading(kernel='rbf', alpha=0.8)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict labels for all data points
predicted_labels = model.transduction_

print(f"Labeled samples: {sum(~unlabeled_mask)}")
print(f"Unlabeled samples: {sum(unlabeled_mask)}")
print(f"Predicted labels: {predicted_labels}")
```

Slide 5: Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge gained from solving one problem to improve performance on a different but related task. This approach is particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load pre-trained VGG16 model
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Freeze the base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add custom layers for the new task
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the new model
new_model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

# Compile the model
new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

print(new_model.summary())
```

Slide 6: Online Learning

Online learning, also known as incremental learning, processes data sequentially and updates the model continuously. This approach is useful for handling large-scale or streaming data where batch processing is impractical.

```python
from river import linear_model
from river import metrics

# Initialize the model and metric
model = linear_model.LogisticRegression()
metric = metrics.Accuracy()

# Simulate a stream of data
for _ in range(1000):
    x = {'feature1': np.random.rand(), 'feature2': np.random.rand()}
    y = 1 if sum(x.values()) > 1 else 0
    
    # Make a prediction
    y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
    
    # Update the metric
    metric.update(y, y_pred)
    
    # Train the model
    model.learn_one(x, y)

print(f"Final accuracy: {metric.get():.4f}")
```

Slide 7: Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])

# Hyperparameters
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.6
epsilon = 0.1
episodes = 1000

for _ in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        if np.random.random() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])
        
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Update Q-table
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])
        
        state = next_state

print("Training completed.")
```

Slide 8: Incremental Learning

Incremental learning allows models to continuously update and improve their knowledge as new data becomes available. This approach is particularly useful for systems that need to adapt to changing environments or handle growing datasets.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate initial dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)

# Initial training
model.fit(X[:800], y[:800])

# Test initial performance
initial_accuracy = accuracy_score(y[800:], model.predict(X[800:]))
print(f"Initial accuracy: {initial_accuracy:.4f}")

# Simulate new data arrival and incremental learning
new_X, new_y = make_classification(n_samples=200, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=43)

# Update the model with new data
model = model.fit(new_X, new_y)

# Test updated performance
updated_accuracy = accuracy_score(new_y, model.predict(new_X))
print(f"Updated accuracy: {updated_accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 9: Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. It has shown remarkable performance in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten

# Define a simple CNN model for image classification
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Image classification is a common application of machine learning, particularly deep learning. It involves training models to recognize and categorize objects within images. This technique is used in various fields, including medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and content moderation on social media platforms.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess an image
img_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(x)

# Make a prediction
predictions = model.predict(x)
decoded_predictions = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]

# Print the top 3 predictions
for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
    print(f"{i + 1}: {label} ({score:.2f})")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another area where machine learning, especially deep learning, has made significant advancements. NLP techniques are used in various applications, such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Sample texts
texts = [
    "I love this product! It's amazing.",
    "This movie was terrible and a waste of time.",
    "The weather today is okay, not great but not bad either."
]

# Perform sentiment analysis
for text in texts:
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)[0]
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```

Slide 12: Challenges and Considerations

While machine learning offers powerful tools for solving complex problems, it also comes with challenges and ethical considerations. These include:

1. Data quality and quantity
2. Model interpretability
3. Bias and fairness
4. Privacy concerns
5. Computational resources
6. Generalization to new scenarios

Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing robust and responsible ML systems.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

challenges = ['Data Quality', 'Interpretability', 'Bias & Fairness', 
              'Privacy', 'Computation', 'Generalization']
importance = np.random.randint(60, 100, len(challenges))

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(challenges, importance)
plt.title('Importance of ML Challenges')
plt.ylabel('Importance Score')
plt.ylim(0, 100)
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
