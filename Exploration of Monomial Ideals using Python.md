## Exploration of Monomial Ideals using Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Monomial Ideals

Monomial ideals are fundamental objects in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. They are ideals generated by monomials in a polynomial ring. Understanding monomial ideals is crucial for various applications in algebra, combinatorics, and computational algebra.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')

# Create a monomial ideal
I = sp.ideal(x**2*y, y**3*z, x*z**2)

print(f"Monomial Ideal: {I}")
print(f"Generators: {I.gens}")
```

Slide 2: Basic Definitions

A monomial in variables x₁, ..., xₙ is a product of the form x₁^a₁ \* ... \* xₙ^aₙ, where a₁, ..., aₙ are non-negative integers. A monomial ideal is an ideal generated by a set of monomials.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, ZZ

def is_monomial(poly):
    return all(coeff == 1 for coeff in poly.coeffs())

x, y = symbols('x y')
f = x**2 * y + 2*x*y**2
g = x**3 * y**2

print(f"Is {f} a monomial? {is_monomial(Poly(f, x, y, domain=ZZ))}")
print(f"Is {g} a monomial? {is_monomial(Poly(g, x, y, domain=ZZ))}")
```

Slide 3: Generating Monomial Ideals

Monomial ideals can be generated by a finite set of monomials. The ideal contains all polynomials that are linear combinations of multiples of these generating monomials.

```python
import sympy as sp

def generate_monomial_ideal(gens):
    x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')
    return sp.ideal(*gens)

gens = [x**2*y, y**3*z, x*z**2]
I = generate_monomial_ideal(gens)

print(f"Generated Monomial Ideal: {I}")
print(f"Is x**3*y**2 in the ideal? {I.contains(x**3*y**2)}")
print(f"Is x*y*z in the ideal? {I.contains(x*y*z)}")
```

Slide 4: Divisibility and Monomial Ideals

In monomial ideals, divisibility plays a crucial role. A monomial m is in a monomial ideal I if and only if m is divisible by one of the generators of I.

```python
def is_divisible(m, g):
    return all(m_exp >= g_exp for m_exp, g_exp in zip(m, g))

def is_in_monomial_ideal(m, gens):
    return any(is_divisible(m, g) for g in gens)

# Example
m = (3, 2, 1)  # represents x^3 * y^2 * z
gens = [(2, 1, 0), (0, 3, 1), (1, 0, 2)]  # generators of the ideal

print(f"Is {m} in the ideal? {is_in_monomial_ideal(m, gens)}")
```

Slide 5: Gröbner Bases for Monomial Ideals

For monomial ideals, the set of minimal generators forms a Gröbner basis with respect to any monomial order. This property simplifies many computations involving monomial ideals.

```python
from sympy import groebner, symbols, Poly

def minimal_generators(gens):
    x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
    G = groebner(gens, x, y, z)
    return [g for g in G if g.is_monomial]

gens = [x**2*y, y**3*z, x*z**2, x**3*y]
min_gens = minimal_generators(gens)

print(f"Original generators: {gens}")
print(f"Minimal generators: {min_gens}")
```

Slide 6: Monomial Order

A monomial order is a total order on monomials that respects multiplication. Common monomial orders include lexicographic, graded lexicographic, and graded reverse lexicographic orders.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, lex, grlex, grevlex

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
f = x**2*y*z + x*y**3 + z**4

print("Polynomial:", f)
print("Lex order:", Poly(f, x, y, z, order=lex))
print("Graded lex order:", Poly(f, x, y, z, order=grlex))
print("Graded reverse lex order:", Poly(f, x, y, z, order=grevlex))
```

Slide 7: Hilbert Function of Monomial Ideals

The Hilbert function of a monomial ideal I in k\[x₁, ..., xₙ\] counts the number of monomials of each degree not in I. It provides important information about the structure of the ideal.

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Poly, ZZ

def hilbert_function(gens, max_degree):
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    I = Poly(sum(gens), x, y, domain=ZZ).ideal()
    
    hilbert = []
    for d in range(max_degree + 1):
        count = sum(1 for i in range(d + 1) 
                    for j in range(d + 1) 
                    if i + j == d and not I.contains(x**i * y**j))
        hilbert.append(count)
    
    return hilbert

gens = [x**2, x*y, y**3]
hf = hilbert_function(gens, 5)

print("Hilbert function:")
for d, value in enumerate(hf):
    print(f"H({d}) = {value}")
```

Slide 8: Real-life Example: Error-Correcting Codes

Monomial ideals play a role in algebraic coding theory, particularly in the study of evaluation codes. Consider a simple error-correcting code based on monomials:

```python
import itertools

def generate_codewords(gens, field_size):
    max_degree = max(sum(g) for g in gens)
    points = list(itertools.product(range(field_size), repeat=2))
    
    codewords = []
    for point in points:
        codeword = [sum(point[i]**g[i] for i in range(2)) % field_size 
                    for g in gens]
        codewords.append(codeword)
    
    return codewords

gens = [(2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 3)]  # x^2, xy, y^3
field_size = 3

codewords = generate_codewords(gens, field_size)
print("Codewords:")
for codeword in codewords:
    print(codeword)
```

Slide 9: Monomial Ideals and Staircase Diagrams

Monomial ideals in two variables can be visualized using staircase diagrams. These diagrams provide an intuitive understanding of the ideal's structure.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_staircase(gens, max_degree):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    
    for g in gens:
        ax.plot([g[0], g[0], max_degree], [max_degree, g[1], g[1]], 'r-')
    
    ax.set_xlim(0, max_degree)
    ax.set_ylim(0, max_degree)
    ax.set_xlabel('x degree')
    ax.set_ylabel('y degree')
    ax.set_title('Staircase Diagram')
    ax.grid(True)
    
    plt.show()

gens = [(2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 3)]
plot_staircase(gens, 5)
```

Slide 10: Operations on Monomial Ideals

Monomial ideals support various algebraic operations, including intersection, sum, and product. These operations are important for manipulating and combining ideals.

```python
from sympy import symbols, ideal

x, y = symbols('x y')

I = ideal(x**2, x*y)
J = ideal(y**2, x*y)

intersection = I.intersection(J)
sum_ideal = I + J
product = I * J

print(f"I ∩ J = {intersection}")
print(f"I + J = {sum_ideal}")
print(f"I * J = {product}")
```

Slide 11: Radical of Monomial Ideals

The radical of a monomial ideal has a simple characterization: it is obtained by replacing each generator with its square-free part.

```python
from sympy import symbols, ideal

def radical_monomial_ideal(I):
    return ideal(*[m.as_coeff_Mul()[1] for m in I.gens])

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
I = ideal(x**2*y, y**3*z**2, x**4*z)

rad_I = radical_monomial_ideal(I)

print(f"Original ideal: {I}")
print(f"Radical: {rad_I}")
```

Slide 12: Primary Decomposition of Monomial Ideals

Every monomial ideal has a unique irredundant primary decomposition into monomial ideals. This decomposition provides insight into the ideal's structure.

```python
from sympy import symbols, ideal, factor_list

def primary_decomposition(I):
    decomp = []
    for g in I.gens:
        factors = factor_list(g)[1]
        p_ideal = ideal(*[f[0] for f in factors])
        if p_ideal not in decomp:
            decomp.append(p_ideal)
    return decomp

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
I = ideal(x**2*y, y**3*z**2, x**2*z**2)

pd = primary_decomposition(I)

print("Primary decomposition:")
for i, p in enumerate(pd, 1):
    print(f"P{i} = {p}")
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Chemical Reaction Networks

Monomial ideals can model chemical reaction networks, where monomials represent molecular species and ideal generators represent reactions.

```python
from sympy import symbols, ideal

def reaction_ideal(reactions):
    return ideal(*[r[1] - r[0] for r in reactions])

A, B, C, D = symbols('A B C D')

# Reactions: A + B -> C, 2C -> D + B
reactions = [(A*B, C), (C**2, D*B)]

I = reaction_ideal(reactions)

print("Reaction ideal:")
print(I)

# Check if the network is balanced
is_balanced = all(sum(r[1].as_coefficients_dict().values()) == 
                  sum(r[0].as_coefficients_dict().values()) 
                  for r in reactions)

print(f"Is the network balanced? {is_balanced}")
```

Slide 14: Conclusion and Future Directions

Monomial ideals form a bridge between algebra and combinatorics, with applications in various fields. Future research directions include exploring connections with tropical geometry, studying persistence modules, and developing more efficient algorithms for computations with large monomial ideals.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def lcm_lattice(gens):
    G = nx.Graph()
    for i, g1 in enumerate(gens):
        for j, g2 in enumerate(gens[i+1:], i+1):
            lcm = tuple(max(a, b) for a, b in zip(g1, g2))
            G.add_edge(g1, lcm)
            G.add_edge(g2, lcm)
    return G

gens = [(2,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,2,1)]
G = lcm_lattice(gens)

pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, font_size=8)
plt.title("LCM Lattice of Monomial Ideal Generators")
plt.show()
```
