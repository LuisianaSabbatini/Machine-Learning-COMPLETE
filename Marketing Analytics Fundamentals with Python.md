## Marketing Analytics Fundamentals with Python

Slide 1: Introduction Marketing Analytics Fundamentals with Python Welcome to this TikTok series, where we'll explore the fundamentals of marketing analytics using the powerful Python programming language.

Slide 2: Data Collection Collecting Data from APIs Gather data from various sources, such as web APIs, for marketing analytics.

Code Example:

```python
import requests

# Set API endpoint and parameters
url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
params = {'start_date': '2023-01-01', 'end_date': '2023-03-31'}

# Send the request and retrieve data
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = response.json()
```

Slide 3: Data Preprocessing Cleaning and Transforming Data Preprocess data by handling missing values, converting data types, and transforming features.

Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('marketing_data.csv')

# Drop missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Convert categorical features to numerical
encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['product_category'] = encoder.fit_transform(data['product_category'])
```

Slide 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualizing Data Create various visualizations to explore and understand your data.

Code Example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='purchase_amount', data=data, hue='gender')
plt.title('Purchase Amount by Age and Gender')
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Customer Segmentation K-Means Clustering Segment customers using K-means clustering based on relevant features.

Code Example:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data[['age', 'income', 'num_purchases']])

# Perform K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(data_scaled)
data['segment'] = clusters
```

Slide 6: Customer Segmentation Hierarchical Clustering Alternatively, use hierarchical clustering to segment customers.

Code Example:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

# Perform hierarchical clustering
cluster = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=4)
clusters = cluster.fit_predict(data[['age', 'income', 'num_purchases']])
data['segment'] = clusters
```

Slide 7: Marketing Campaign Analysis Calculating Conversion Rates Analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by calculating conversion rates.

Code Example:

```python
# Calculate overall conversion rate
total_conversions = data[data['converted'] == True].shape[0]
total_visitors = data.shape[0]
overall_conversion_rate = total_conversions / total_visitors

# Calculate conversion rate by campaign
campaign_conversion_rates = data.groupby('campaign')['converted'].mean()
```

Slide 8: Marketing Campaign Analysis Customer Acquisition Cost Determine the cost of acquiring new customers for each marketing campaign.

Code Example:

```python
# Calculate customer acquisition cost
campaign_costs = data.groupby('campaign')['campaign_cost'].sum()
new_customers = data[data['converted'] == True].groupby('campaign')['customer_id'].nunique()
customer_acquisition_cost = campaign_costs / new_customers
```

Slide 9: Predictive Modeling Logistic Regression Build a logistic regression model to predict customer behavior, such as likelihood to purchase.

Code Example:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into features and target
X = data[['age', 'income', 'num_purchases']]
y = data['converted']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 10: Predictive Modeling Random Forest Classifier Alternatively, use a random forest classifier for predicting customer behavior.

Code Example:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train the random forest classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
```

Slide 11: A/B Testing Chi-Squared Test Conduct a chi-squared test to compare the performance of different marketing strategies.

Code Example:

```python
import statsmodels.stats.api as sms

# Perform a chi-squared test
control_conversions = data[data['group'] == 'control']['converted'].sum()
test_conversions = data[data['group'] == 'test']['converted'].sum()
chi2, p_val, dof, ex = sms.chi2_contingency([[control_conversions, test_conversions]])
print(f'p-value: {p_val}')
```

Slide 12: Visualizations and Reporting Interactive Dashboards Create interactive dashboards to effectively communicate insights and recommendations to stakeholders.

Code Example:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Create an interactive scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(data, x='age', y='purchase_amount', color='gender', size='num_purchases',
                 hover_data=['product_category'])
fig.update_layout(title='Customer Purchase Behavior')
fig.show()
```

This revised slide deck covers a wide range of marketing analytics topics, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation (with different clustering techniques), campaign analysis, predictive modeling (with logistic regression and random forest classifiers), A/B testing, and interactive visualizations. Each slide now includes a code example to demonstrate the practical application of these concepts using Python.
