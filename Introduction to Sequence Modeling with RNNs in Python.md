## Introduction to Sequence Modeling with RNNs in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Sequence Modeling with RNNs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, such as text, speech, and time series data. RNNs maintain an internal state that captures information from previous inputs, allowing them to model the dependencies and patterns present in sequential data.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Input

# Define the input shape
input_shape = (None, 10)  # (batch_size, time_steps, features)

# Define the RNN layer
rnn_layer = SimpleRNN(64, return_sequences=True)

# Create the input layer
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape[1:])

# Pass the input through the RNN layer
outputs = rnn_layer(inputs)
```

Slide 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTMs are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are designed to overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problem that standard RNNs suffer from, making them more effective for capturing long-range dependencies.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM

# Define the LSTM layer
lstm_layer = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)

# Pass the input through the LSTM layer
outputs = lstm_layer(inputs)
```

Slide 3: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

GRUs are another type of RNN that, like LSTMs, are designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are similar to LSTMs but have a simpler architecture, making them computationally more efficient while still maintaining comparable performance.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU

# Define the GRU layer
gru_layer = GRU(96, return_sequences=True)

# Pass the input through the GRU layer
outputs = gru_layer(inputs)
```

Slide 4: Combining Convolutional and Recurrent Layers

Combining convolutional layers (Conv1D) and recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM, GRU) can be beneficial for tasks like sequence labeling, machine translation, and text classification. The Conv1D layers can extract local features, while the recurrent layers can capture long-range dependencies.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, LSTM

# Define the Conv1D layer
conv_layer = Conv1D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')

# Define the LSTM layer
lstm_layer = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)

# Pass the input through the layers
conv_out = conv_layer(inputs)
outputs = lstm_layer(conv_out)
```

Slide 5: Transformers for Sequence Modeling

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Attention, Dense

# Define the Attention layer
attention_layer = Attention(use_scale=True)

# Define the Dense layer
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')

# Pass the input through the layers
attention_out = attention_layer(inputs, inputs)
outputs = output_layer(attention_out)
```

Slide 6: Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Modeling

Seq2Seq models are a type of neural network architecture that can map input sequences to output sequences, making them suitable for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. They typically consist of an encoder (e.g., RNN, LSTM, GRU) that encodes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define the encoder LSTM
encoder_lstm = LSTM(128, return_state=True)

# Define the decoder LSTM
decoder_lstm = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)

# Define the Dense layer for output
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')

# Encode the input sequence
_, state_h, state_c = encoder_lstm(inputs)

# Initialize the decoder with the encoder states
outputs = []
decoder_input = tf.zeros((batch_size, 1))
for _ in range(max_len):
    decoder_out, state_h, state_c = decoder_lstm(decoder_input, initial_state=[state_h, state_c])
    output_token = output_layer(decoder_out)
    outputs.append(output_token)
    decoder_input = tf.expand_dims(tf.argmax(output_token, axis=-1), 1)
```

Slide 7: Time Series Forecasting with RNNs

RNNs, particularly LSTMs and GRUs, are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks, where the goal is to predict future values based on past observations. They can capture the temporal dependencies and patterns present in time series data.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(None, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

Slide 8: Sentiment Analysis with RNNs

RNNs can be used for sentiment analysis tasks, where the goal is to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given text. The RNN can learn to capture the contextual information and long-range dependencies in the text, which are important for accurately determining sentiment.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Tokenize the text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 128, input_length=max_len),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(np.array(sequences), labels, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

Slide 9: Language Modeling with RNNs

Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word in a sequence given the previous words. RNNs, especially LSTMs and GRUs, are well-suited for this task as they can capture the long-range dependencies and context present in natural language.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Tokenize the text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 128, input_length=max_len - 1),
    LSTM(256),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64)
```

Slide 10: Text Generation with RNNs

RNNs can be used for text generation tasks, where the goal is to generate new text based on a given input seed text. The RNN learns the patterns and dependencies in the training data and can then generate new text by sampling from its output distribution.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Tokenize the text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, 128, input_length=max_len - 1),
    LSTM(256, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(256),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64)

# Generate new text
seed_text = "The quick brown fox"
next_words = 100

for _ in range(next_words):
    token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([seed_text])[0]
    token_list = pad_sequences([token_list], maxlen=max_len - 1, padding='pre')
    predicted = model.predict_classes(token_list, verbose=0)
    output_word = tokenizer.index_word.get(predicted[-1], "")
    seed_text += " " + output_word

print(seed_text)
```

Slide 11: Machine Translation with Seq2Seq Models

Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which consist of an encoder and a decoder, are commonly used for machine translation tasks. The encoder encodes the input sequence (source language), and the decoder generates the output sequence (target language).

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define the encoder
encoder_inputs = Input(shape=(None,))
encoder_embedding = Embedding(src_vocab_size, 256)(encoder_inputs)
encoder_lstm = LSTM(256, return_state=True)
encoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = encoder_lstm(encoder_embedding)

# Define the decoder
decoder_inputs = Input(shape=(None,))
decoder_embedding = Embedding(tgt_vocab_size, 256)(decoder_inputs)
decoder_lstm = LSTM(256, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
decoder_outputs, _, _ = decoder_lstm(decoder_embedding, initial_state=[state_h, state_c])
decoder_dense = Dense(tgt_vocab_size, activation='softmax')
decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)

# Define the model
model = Model([encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs], decoder_outputs)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

# Train the model
model.fit([source_sequences, target_sequences], target_sequences, batch_size=64, epochs=10)
```

Slide 12: Speech Recognition with RNNs

RNNs, particularly LSTMs and GRUs, can be used for speech recognition tasks, where the goal is to transcribe audio signals into text. The RNN can learn to model the temporal dependencies and patterns present in the audio data.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(128, input_shape=(None, 13)),
    Dense(29, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
