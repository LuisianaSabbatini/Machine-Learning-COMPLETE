## Matrix Operations in Python
Slide 1: 
Introduction to Matrices in Python

Matrices are two-dimensional arrays that represent a collection of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Python provides several ways to work with matrices, including the NumPy library, which offers powerful tools for scientific computing and linear algebra operations.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(matrix)
```

Slide 2: 
Creating Matrices with NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for working with arrays and matrices in Python. It provides various functions to create and manipulate matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2x3 matrix
matrix_1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Creating a 3x3 matrix with all zeros
matrix_2 = np.zeros((3, 3))

# Creating a 3x3 identity matrix
matrix_3 = np.eye(3)
```

Slide 3: 
Matrix Operations

NumPy supports various arithmetic operations on matrices, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar operations.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix_1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix addition
result_1 = matrix_1 + matrix_2
print(result_1)

# Matrix multiplication
result_2 = matrix_1 @ matrix_2
print(result_2)

# Scalar multiplication
result_3 = 2 * matrix_1
print(result_3)
```

Slide 4: 
Accessing Matrix Elements

Matrices can be indexed and sliced like regular NumPy arrays to access or modify their elements.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Accessing an element
print(matrix[1, 1])  # Output: 5

# Modifying an element
matrix[0, 0] = 10
print(matrix)

# Slicing a matrix
submatrix = matrix[0:2, 1:3]
print(submatrix)
```

Slide 5: 
Matrix Reshaping

NumPy provides functions to reshape matrices by changing their dimensions while preserving the order of elements.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
print(matrix)

# Reshaping a matrix
reshaped_matrix = matrix.reshape(4, 2)
print(reshaped_matrix)

# Flattening a matrix
flattened_matrix = matrix.flatten()
print(flattened_matrix)
```

Slide 6: 
Matrix Transposition

Transposing a matrix means interchanging its rows and columns. NumPy provides a convenient method for transposing matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Original Matrix:")
print(matrix)

# Transposing a matrix
transposed_matrix = matrix.T
print("Transposed Matrix:")
print(transposed_matrix)
```

Slide 7: 
Matrix Multiplication

NumPy provides efficient matrix multiplication operations, which are essential for various mathematical and scientific applications.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix_1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix_2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix multiplication
result = matrix_1 @ matrix_2
print(result)
```

Slide 8: 
Matrix Inverse and Determinant

NumPy offers functions to calculate the inverse and determinant of a square matrix, which are important concepts in linear algebra.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Calculating the inverse of a matrix
inverse_matrix = np.linalg.inv(matrix)
print(inverse_matrix)

# Calculating the determinant of a matrix
determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix)
print(determinant)
```

Slide 9: 
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra and have numerous applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and data analysis.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[3, 1], [1, 3]])

# Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(matrix)

print("Eigenvalues:")
print(eigenvalues)

print("Eigenvectors:")
print(eigenvectors)
```

Slide 10: 
Matrix Decompositions

NumPy provides functions for matrix decompositions, such as LU decomposition, QR decomposition, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which are useful in various applications.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# LU decomposition
P, L, U = np.linalg.lu(matrix)
print("P:\n", P)
print("L:\n", L)
print("U:\n", U)
```

Slide 11: 
Matrix Norms

Matrix norms are scalar values that measure the magnitude or size of a matrix. NumPy provides functions to calculate different types of norms, such as the Frobenius norm and the induced norms.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Frobenius norm
frobenius_norm = np.linalg.norm(matrix, 'fro')
print(frobenius_norm)

# Induced 2-norm (maximum singular value)
induced_norm = np.linalg.norm(matrix, 2)
print(induced_norm)
```

Slide 12: 
Solving Linear Systems

NumPy provides functions to solve linear systems of equations represented by matrices, which is a fundamental task in many scientific and engineering applications.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([5, 11])

# Solving the linear system Ax = b
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
print(x)
```

Slide 13: 
Broadcasting in Matrix Operations

NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows arithmetic operations between arrays with different shapes, following specific rules. This feature is useful for performing operations on matrices with scalars or vectors.

```python
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
scalar = 2
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Scalar multiplication
result_1 = matrix * scalar
print(result_1)

# Vector addition
result_2 = matrix + vector
print(result_2)
```
