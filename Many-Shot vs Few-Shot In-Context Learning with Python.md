## Many-Shot vs Few-Shot In-Context Learning with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Many-Shot vs Few-Shot In-Context Learning

In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial aspect of Large Language Models (LLMs). This presentation explores the differences between many-shot and few-shot ICL, focusing on their implementation and practical applications using Python.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulating performance of many-shot vs few-shot learning
shots = np.arange(1, 101)
many_shot = 1 - np.exp(-0.05 * shots)
few_shot = 1 - np.exp(-0.2 * shots)

plt.plot(shots, many_shot, label='Many-shot')
plt.plot(shots, few_shot, label='Few-shot')
plt.xlabel('Number of examples')
plt.ylabel('Performance')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Many-shot vs Few-shot Learning Curves')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Many-Shot In-Context Learning

Many-shot ICL involves providing the model with numerous examples to learn from. This approach typically leads to better performance but requires more data and computational resources.

```python
def many_shot_sentiment_analysis(text, examples):
    prompt = "Classify the sentiment of the following text as positive or negative:\n\n"
    for example in examples:
        prompt += f"Text: {example['text']}\nSentiment: {example['sentiment']}\n\n"
    prompt += f"Text: {text}\nSentiment:"
    
    # In a real scenario, you would send this prompt to an LLM API
    # For demonstration, we'll use a simple rule-based classifier
    return "positive" if "good" in text.lower() or "great" in text.lower() else "negative"

# Example usage
examples = [
    {"text": "I love this product!", "sentiment": "positive"},
    {"text": "The service was terrible.", "sentiment": "negative"},
    {"text": "It's an amazing experience.", "sentiment": "positive"},
    # ... many more examples ...
]

result = many_shot_sentiment_analysis("The food was great!", examples)
print(f"Sentiment: {result}")
```

Slide 3: Few-Shot In-Context Learning

Few-shot ICL uses a limited number of examples, typically 2-5, to guide the model's understanding. This approach is more efficient in terms of prompt length and processing time but may sacrifice some accuracy.

```python
def few_shot_sentiment_analysis(text, examples):
    prompt = "Classify the sentiment of the following text as positive or negative:\n\n"
    for example in examples[:3]:  # Using only 3 examples
        prompt += f"Text: {example['text']}\nSentiment: {example['sentiment']}\n\n"
    prompt += f"Text: {text}\nSentiment:"
    
    # In a real scenario, you would send this prompt to an LLM API
    # For demonstration, we'll use a simple rule-based classifier
    return "positive" if "good" in text.lower() or "great" in text.lower() else "negative"

# Example usage
examples = [
    {"text": "I love this product!", "sentiment": "positive"},
    {"text": "The service was terrible.", "sentiment": "negative"},
    {"text": "It's an average experience.", "sentiment": "neutral"},
]

result = few_shot_sentiment_analysis("The food was great!", examples)
print(f"Sentiment: {result}")
```

Slide 4: Comparing Many-Shot and Few-Shot Performance

Let's compare the performance of many-shot and few-shot approaches using a simple text classification task.

```python
import random

def generate_data(n):
    words = ["good", "great", "excellent", "amazing", "bad", "terrible", "awful", "poor"]
    data = []
    for _ in range(n):
        sentiment = random.choice(["positive", "negative"])
        text = f"This product is {random.choice(words)}."
        data.append({"text": text, "sentiment": sentiment})
    return data

def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    correct = 0
    for item in test_data:
        prediction = model(item["text"], train_data)
        if prediction == item["sentiment"]:
            correct += 1
    return correct / len(test_data)

# Generate data
train_data = generate_data(100)
test_data = generate_data(50)

# Evaluate models
many_shot_accuracy = evaluate_model(many_shot_sentiment_analysis, test_data)
few_shot_accuracy = evaluate_model(few_shot_sentiment_analysis, test_data)

print(f"Many-shot accuracy: {many_shot_accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Few-shot accuracy: {few_shot_accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Advantages of Many-Shot Learning

Many-shot learning often leads to better performance due to the wealth of examples provided. It allows the model to learn from a diverse set of scenarios, potentially improving generalization.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def performance_curve(n_examples, learning_rate):
    return 1 - np.exp(-learning_rate * n_examples)

n_examples = np.arange(1, 101)
many_shot = performance_curve(n_examples, 0.05)
few_shot = performance_curve(n_examples, 0.2)

plt.plot(n_examples, many_shot, label='Many-shot')
plt.plot(n_examples, few_shot, label='Few-shot')
plt.xlabel('Number of examples')
plt.ylabel('Performance')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Learning Curves: Many-shot vs Few-shot')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Advantages of Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning is more efficient in terms of prompt length and processing time. It's particularly useful when working with limited data or when quick adaptation to new tasks is required.

```python
import time

def measure_processing_time(func, text, examples):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(text, examples)
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time

text = "The product exceeded my expectations."
many_shot_time = measure_processing_time(many_shot_sentiment_analysis, text, examples)
few_shot_time = measure_processing_time(few_shot_sentiment_analysis, text, examples[:3])

print(f"Many-shot processing time: {many_shot_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Few-shot processing time: {few_shot_time:.6f} seconds")
```

Slide 7: Implementing Many-Shot Learning for Named Entity Recognition

Let's implement a many-shot learning approach for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a simple rule-based system.

```python
def many_shot_ner(text, examples):
    prompt = "Identify named entities (Person, Organization, Location) in the following text:\n\n"
    for example in examples:
        prompt += f"Text: {example['text']}\nEntities: {example['entities']}\n\n"
    prompt += f"Text: {text}\nEntities:"
    
    # In a real scenario, you would send this prompt to an LLM API
    # For demonstration, we'll use a simple rule-based system
    entities = []
    for word in text.split():
        if word[0].isupper():
            if word in ["Inc.", "Corp.", "LLC"]:
                entities.append((word, "Organization"))
            elif word in ["Street", "Avenue", "Road"]:
                entities.append((word, "Location"))
            else:
                entities.append((word, "Person"))
    return entities

# Example usage
examples = [
    {"text": "John works at Google in New York.", 
     "entities": [("John", "Person"), ("Google", "Organization"), ("New York", "Location")]},
    {"text": "Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.", 
     "entities": [("Apple Inc.", "Organization"), ("Cupertino", "Location")]},
    # ... many more examples ...
]

result = many_shot_ner("Microsoft Corp. was founded by Bill Gates in Redmond.", examples)
print(f"Entities: {result}")
```

Slide 8: Implementing Few-Shot Learning for Named Entity Recognition

Now, let's implement a few-shot learning approach for the same NER task.

```python
def few_shot_ner(text, examples):
    prompt = "Identify named entities (Person, Organization, Location) in the following text:\n\n"
    for example in examples[:2]:  # Using only 2 examples
        prompt += f"Text: {example['text']}\nEntities: {example['entities']}\n\n"
    prompt += f"Text: {text}\nEntities:"
    
    # In a real scenario, you would send this prompt to an LLM API
    # For demonstration, we'll use a simple rule-based system
    entities = []
    for word in text.split():
        if word[0].isupper():
            if word in ["Inc.", "Corp.", "LLC"]:
                entities.append((word, "Organization"))
            elif word in ["Street", "Avenue", "Road"]:
                entities.append((word, "Location"))
            else:
                entities.append((word, "Person"))
    return entities

# Example usage
examples = [
    {"text": "John works at Google in New York.", 
     "entities": [("John", "Person"), ("Google", "Organization"), ("New York", "Location")]},
    {"text": "Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.", 
     "entities": [("Apple Inc.", "Organization"), ("Cupertino", "Location")]},
]

result = few_shot_ner("Microsoft Corp. was founded by Bill Gates in Redmond.", examples)
print(f"Entities: {result}")
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

Let's apply many-shot and few-shot learning to analyze sentiment in product reviews.

```python
import random

def generate_reviews(n):
    positive_words = ["great", "excellent", "amazing", "wonderful", "fantastic"]
    negative_words = ["terrible", "awful", "disappointing", "poor", "bad"]
    reviews = []
    for _ in range(n):
        sentiment = random.choice(["positive", "negative"])
        words = positive_words if sentiment == "positive" else negative_words
        review = f"This product is {random.choice(words)}. I {'would' if sentiment == 'positive' else 'would not'} recommend it."
        reviews.append({"text": review, "sentiment": sentiment})
    return reviews

# Generate example reviews
examples = generate_reviews(20)

# Test reviews
test_reviews = [
    "This gadget is fantastic! It works perfectly and saves me so much time.",
    "I'm very disappointed with this purchase. The quality is poor and it broke after a week."
]

for review in test_reviews:
    many_shot_result = many_shot_sentiment_analysis(review, examples)
    few_shot_result = few_shot_sentiment_analysis(review, examples[:3])
    print(f"Review: {review}")
    print(f"Many-shot sentiment: {many_shot_result}")
    print(f"Few-shot sentiment: {few_shot_result}\n")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Named Entity Recognition in News Headlines

Let's apply many-shot and few-shot learning to perform Named Entity Recognition on news headlines.

```python
# Example headlines
headlines = [
    "Apple unveils new iPhone at annual event in California",
    "NASA successfully launches Mars rover from Cape Canaveral",
    "President Biden meets with German Chancellor in Washington D.C."
]

# Example data for training
examples = [
    {"text": "Amazon opens new office in Seattle", 
     "entities": [("Amazon", "Organization"), ("Seattle", "Location")]},
    {"text": "Elon Musk announces Tesla's expansion to Europe", 
     "entities": [("Elon Musk", "Person"), ("Tesla", "Organization"), ("Europe", "Location")]},
]

for headline in headlines:
    many_shot_entities = many_shot_ner(headline, examples)
    few_shot_entities = few_shot_ner(headline, examples)
    print(f"Headline: {headline}")
    print(f"Many-shot NER: {many_shot_entities}")
    print(f"Few-shot NER: {few_shot_entities}\n")
```

Slide 11: Choosing Between Many-Shot and Few-Shot Learning

The choice between many-shot and few-shot learning depends on various factors such as available data, computational resources, and the specific task at hand.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

factors = ['Data Availability', 'Computational Resources', 'Task Complexity', 'Adaptation Speed']
many_shot_scores = [0.9, 0.8, 0.9, 0.6]
few_shot_scores = [0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.9]

x = range(len(factors))
width = 0.35

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.bar([i - width/2 for i in x], many_shot_scores, width, label='Many-shot')
ax.bar([i + width/2 for i in x], few_shot_scores, width, label='Few-shot')

ax.set_ylabel('Suitability Score')
ax.set_title('Many-shot vs Few-shot: Suitability for Different Factors')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(factors)
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Hybrid Approaches: Combining Many-Shot and Few-Shot Learning

In some cases, a hybrid approach combining elements of both many-shot and few-shot learning can be beneficial.

```python
def hybrid_sentiment_analysis(text, many_shot_examples, few_shot_examples):
    # Use many-shot learning for initial classification
    many_shot_result = many_shot_sentiment_analysis(text, many_shot_examples)
    
    # Use few-shot learning for confidence check
    few_shot_result = few_shot_sentiment_analysis(text, few_shot_examples)
    
    # If results agree, return with high confidence
    if many_shot_result == few_shot_result:
        return many_shot_result, "High"
    else:
        # If results disagree, return many-shot result with low confidence
        return many_shot_result, "Low"

# Example usage
many_shot_examples = generate_reviews(50)
few_shot_examples = generate_reviews(5)

test_text = "This product exceeds expectations in every way. Highly recommended!"
result, confidence = hybrid_sentiment_analysis(test_text, many_shot_examples, few_shot_examples)

print(f"Text: {test_text}")
print(f"Sentiment: {result}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence}")
```

Slide 13: Future Directions in In-Context Learning

As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect advancements in both many-shot and few-shot learning techniques, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate models.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def future_performance(x, current_rate, improvement_rate):
    return 1 - np.exp(-(current_rate + improvement_rate * x))

x = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)
many_shot = future_performance(x, 0.05, 0.01)
few_shot = future_performance(x, 0.2, 0.05)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, many_shot, label='Many-shot')
plt.plot(x, few_shot, label='Few-shot')
plt.xlabel('Time (years)')
plt.ylabel('Performance')
plt.title('Projected Improvements in Many-shot and Few-shot Learning')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
