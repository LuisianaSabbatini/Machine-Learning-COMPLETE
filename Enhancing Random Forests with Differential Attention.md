## Enhancing Random Forests with Differential Attention
Slide 1: Understanding Differential Attention Mechanism

Differential attention mechanism enhances random forest performance by assigning importance weights to features based on their statistical variance. This approach leverages the intuition that features with higher variability contain more discriminative information for classification tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_differential_attention(X):
    # Calculate variance for each feature
    feature_variance = np.var(X, axis=0)
    # Normalize to get attention weights
    attention_weights = feature_variance / np.sum(feature_variance)
    return attention_weights
```

Slide 2: Feature Weighting Implementation

The feature weighting process applies attention weights to input features, effectively scaling their importance during model training. This transformation preserves the original feature information while emphasizing more informative attributes.

```python
def apply_feature_weights(X, attention_weights):
    # Multiply features by their corresponding attention weights
    weighted_features = X * attention_weights
    return weighted_features

# Example usage
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
weights = calculate_differential_attention(X)
weighted_X = apply_feature_weights(X, weights)
```

Slide 3: Attention-Based Random Forest Architecture

The attention-based random forest extends traditional random forest by incorporating differential attention mechanisms at both feature selection and tree construction stages, enabling dynamic feature importance assessment.

```python
class AttentionRandomForest:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100):
        self.n_estimators = n_estimators
        self.attention_weights = None
        self.forest = None
    
    def _initialize_attention(self, X):
        self.attention_weights = calculate_differential_attention(X)
```

Slide 4: Source Code for Attention-Based Random Forest Architecture

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

class AttentionRandomForest:
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Calculate attention weights
        self._initialize_attention(X)
        
        # Apply weights to features
        weighted_X = apply_feature_weights(X, self.attention_weights)
        
        # Initialize and train random forest
        self.forest = RandomForestClassifier(
            n_estimators=self.n_estimators,
            random_state=42
        )
        self.forest.fit(weighted_X, y)
        return self
    
    def predict(self, X):
        weighted_X = apply_feature_weights(X, self.attention_weights)
        return self.forest.predict(weighted_X)
```

Slide 5: Mathematical Foundation of Differential Attention

The differential attention mechanism is grounded in statistical variance analysis, where feature importance is quantified through variance-based weights calculation. The mathematical formulation defines the relationship between feature variability and attention scores.

```python
"""
Feature Attention Weight Formula:

$$w_i = \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \sigma_j^2}$$

where:
$$\sigma_i^2$$ is the variance of feature i
$$w_i$$ is the attention weight for feature i
"""
```

Slide 6: Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline ensures data quality and compatibility with the attention mechanism by handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the data structure for attention weight calculation.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

def preprocess_data(X):
    # Initialize preprocessors
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    
    # Apply preprocessing
    X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_imputed)
    
    return X_scaled
```

Slide 7: Implementation with Iris Dataset

A practical implementation using the classic Iris dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the attention-based random forest compared to traditional approaches. This example showcases the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and prepare data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

Slide 8: Training Pipeline Implementation

The training pipeline orchestrates data preprocessing, attention weight calculation, and model training in a cohesive workflow. It ensures proper feature weighting and model optimization while maintaining computational efficiency.

```python
class AttentionRFPipeline:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100):
        self.preprocessor = StandardScaler()
        self.model = AttentionRandomForest(n_estimators=n_estimators)
        
    def train(self, X, y):
        # Preprocess features
        X_processed = self.preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Train model with attention mechanism
        self.model.fit(X_processed, y)
        
        return {
            'attention_weights': self.model.attention_weights,
            'feature_importance': self.model.forest.feature_importances_
        }
```

Slide 9: Performance Metrics Implementation

Statistical evaluation of model performance through multiple metrics provides comprehensive insight into the effectiveness of the attention mechanism and its impact on classification accuracy.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred):
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(
        y_true, y_pred, average='weighted'
    )
    
    return {
        'accuracy': accuracy,
        'precision': precision,
        'recall': recall,
        'f1_score': f1
    }
```

Slide 10: Feature Importance Visualization

Visualization of feature importance scores and attention weights provides insights into the model's decision-making process and helps identify key predictive attributes in the dataset.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def plot_attention_weights(feature_names, attention_weights):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x=feature_names, y=attention_weights)
    plt.title('Feature Attention Weights Distribution')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    
    return plt.gcf()
```

Slide 11: Real-world Example - Credit Risk Assessment

A practical application of attention-based random forests in credit risk assessment demonstrates the model's capability to identify crucial financial indicators and improve prediction accuracy.

```python
def process_credit_data(credit_df):
    # Prepare features and target
    X = credit_df.drop('default', axis=1)
    y = credit_df['default']
    
    # Initialize pipeline
    pipeline = AttentionRFPipeline(n_estimators=200)
    
    # Train model
    metrics = pipeline.train(X, y)
    
    return pipeline, metrics
```

Slide 12: Source Code for Credit Risk Assessment

```python
# Complete implementation for credit risk assessment
def credit_risk_analysis():
    # Load credit dataset
    credit_data = pd.read_csv('credit_data.csv')
    
    # Preprocess features
    numeric_features = credit_data.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns
    X = credit_data[numeric_features]
    y = credit_data['default']
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Train attention-based model
    pipeline = AttentionRFPipeline()
    results = pipeline.train(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    y_pred = pipeline.model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    metrics = evaluate_model(y_test, y_pred)
    
    return results, metrics
```

Slide 13: Comparison with Traditional Methods

Empirical comparison between attention-based random forests and traditional approaches reveals performance improvements in terms of accuracy, training time, and feature utilization efficiency.

```python
def compare_models(X, y):
    # Traditional Random Forest
    rf_standard = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    
    # Attention-based Random Forest
    rf_attention = AttentionRandomForest(n_estimators=100)
    
    # Train and evaluate both models
    results = {
        'standard': train_and_evaluate(rf_standard, X, y),
        'attention': train_and_evaluate(rf_attention, X, y)
    }
    
    return results
```
