## Introduction to Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms
Slide 1: Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms

Tree-based machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for decision-making and prediction. These algorithms use tree-like structures to make decisions based on input features. In this presentation, we'll explore various types of tree-based algorithms, their applications, and how to implement them using Python.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple decision tree visualization
def plot_decision_tree():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.set_title("Simple Decision Tree")
    ax.set_xlim(0, 10)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 10)
    ax.set_axis_off()

    # Draw tree structure
    ax.plot([5, 3, 7], [9, 6, 6], 'k-')
    ax.plot([3, 2, 4], [6, 3, 3], 'k-')
    ax.plot([7, 6, 8], [6, 3, 3], 'k-')

    # Add node labels
    ax.text(5, 9.5, "Root", ha='center')
    ax.text(3, 6.5, "Node 1", ha='center')
    ax.text(7, 6.5, "Node 2", ha='center')
    ax.text(2, 2.5, "Leaf 1", ha='center')
    ax.text(4, 2.5, "Leaf 2", ha='center')
    ax.text(6, 2.5, "Leaf 3", ha='center')
    ax.text(8, 2.5, "Leaf 4", ha='center')

    plt.show()

plot_decision_tree()
```

Slide 2: Decision Trees

Decision trees are the foundation of tree-based algorithms. They work by splitting the data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or prediction.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a sample dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a decision tree classifier
dt_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = dt_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = dt_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Decision Tree Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 3: Random Forests

Random forests are an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree in the forest is built using a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all trees for regression tasks or by majority voting for classification tasks.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create and train a random forest classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_rf = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_rf = rf_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_rf:.2f}")

# Feature importance
feature_importance = rf_classifier.feature_importances_
for i, importance in enumerate(feature_importance):
    print(f"Feature {i+1} importance: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Gradient Boosting involves building a series of trees where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. This process is repeated iteratively to improve the model's performance. GBMs are known for their high accuracy and ability to handle various types of data.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Create and train a gradient boosting classifier
gb_classifier = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
gb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_gb = gb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_gb = gb_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Gradient Boosting Accuracy: {accuracy_gb:.2f}")

# Plot learning curve
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve

train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(
    gb_classifier, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10))

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(train_scores, axis=1), label='Training score')
plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(test_scores, axis=1), label='Cross-validation score')
plt.title('Learning Curve for Gradient Boosting')
plt.xlabel('Training examples')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is an optimized version of gradient boosting that is faster and more efficient. It includes regularization to prevent overfitting and supports parallel processing. XGBoost is widely used in competitive machine learning tasks and often achieves high accuracy.

```python
import xgboost as xgb

# Create and train an XGBoost classifier
xgb_classifier = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
xgb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_xgb = xgb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_xgb = xgb_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"XGBoost Accuracy: {accuracy_xgb:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
xgb.plot_importance(xgb_classifier)
plt.title('XGBoost Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses histogram-based algorithms to speed up training and reduce memory usage. It is particularly useful for large-scale machine learning tasks and high-dimensional data.

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

# Create and train a LightGBM classifier
lgb_classifier = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
lgb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_lgb = lgb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_lgb = lgb_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"LightGBM Accuracy: {accuracy_lgb:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
lgb.plot_importance(lgb_classifier)
plt.title('LightGBM Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: CatBoost

CatBoost is another gradient boosting library designed to handle categorical features more effectively. It uses ordered boosting and other techniques to improve performance, particularly in problems with structured data containing categorical features.

```python
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

# Create and train a CatBoost classifier
cb_classifier = CatBoostClassifier(iterations=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42, verbose=False)
cb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_cb = cb_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_cb = cb_classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"CatBoost Accuracy: {accuracy_cb:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
cb_classifier.plot_feature_importance()
plt.title('CatBoost Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Comparing Tree-Based Algorithms

Let's compare the performance of different tree-based algorithms on our sample dataset. We'll create a bar plot to visualize the accuracy of each algorithm.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Collect accuracies
algorithms = ['Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Gradient Boosting', 'XGBoost', 'LightGBM', 'CatBoost']
accuracies = [accuracy, accuracy_rf, accuracy_gb, accuracy_xgb, accuracy_lgb, accuracy_cb]

# Create a DataFrame
df_accuracies = pd.DataFrame({'Algorithm': algorithms, 'Accuracy': accuracies})

# Plot accuracies
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.bar(df_accuracies['Algorithm'], df_accuracies['Accuracy'])
plt.title('Comparison of Tree-Based Algorithm Accuracies')
plt.xlabel('Algorithm')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.ylim(0.8, 1.0)  # Adjust y-axis limits for better visualization
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
for i, v in enumerate(accuracies):
    plt.text(i, v + 0.01, f'{v:.2f}', ha='center')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing the performance of tree-based algorithms. We'll use RandomizedSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of a Random Forest classifier.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt'],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
}

# Create a Random Forest classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Perform randomized search
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=rf, param_distributions=param_grid, 
                                   n_iter=100, cv=5, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best parameters and score
print("Best parameters:", random_search.best_params_)
print("Best cross-validation score:", random_search.best_score_)

# Evaluate on the test set
best_rf = random_search.best_estimator_
accuracy_best_rf = best_rf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Best Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_best_rf:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Feature Importance

Understanding feature importance is crucial when working with tree-based models. Let's visualize the feature importance of our best Random Forest model.

```python
# Get feature importances
importances = best_rf.feature_importances_
feature_names = [f'Feature {i+1}' for i in range(X.shape[1])]

# Sort features by importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': feature_names, 'importance': importances})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(feature_importance['feature'], feature_importance['importance'])
plt.title('Feature Importance in Random Forest Model')
plt.xlabel('Features')
plt.ylabel('Importance')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Handling Imbalanced Data

Tree-based algorithms can be sensitive to imbalanced datasets. Let's explore how to handle this issue using the Random Forest algorithm and the imbalanced-learn library.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create an imbalanced dataset
X_imb, y_imb = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1], 
                                   n_features=10, random_state=42)

# Split the imbalanced data
X_train_imb, X_test_imb, y_train_imb, y_test_imb = train_test_split(X_imb, y_imb, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a pipeline with SMOTE oversampling and Random Forest
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42))
])

# Fit the pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_train_imb, y_train_imb)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy_balanced = pipeline.score(X_test_imb, y_test_imb)
print(f"Balanced Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_balanced:.2f}")

# Compare with imbalanced data
rf_imbalanced = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
rf_imbalanced.fit(X_train_imb, y_train_imb)
accuracy_imbalanced = rf_imbalanced.score(X_test_imb, y_test_imb)
print(f"Imbalanced Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_imbalanced:.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Iris Flower Classification

Let's apply a tree-based algorithm to a real-world problem: classifying iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Decision Tree classifier
dt_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = dt_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Print classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=iris.target_names))

# Visualize the decision tree
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plot_tree(dt_classifier, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names, filled=True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Customer Churn Prediction

In this example, we'll use a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. This scenario demonstrates how tree-based algorithms can be applied to solve real-world business problems.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load the Telco Customer Churn dataset
df = pd.read_csv('telco_customer_churn.csv')

# Preprocess the data
le = LabelEncoder()
df['Churn'] = le.fit_transform(df['Churn'])
df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)

# Split features and target
X = df.drop(['Churn', 'customerID'], axis=1)
y = df['Churn']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Random Forest classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Print classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X.columns,
    'importance': rf_classifier.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print("Top 5 important features:")
print(feature_importance.head())
```

Slide 14: Interpretability of Tree-Based Models

One of the key advantages of tree-based models is their interpretability. Let's explore how we can visualize and interpret a decision tree from our Random Forest model.

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

# Select a single tree from the Random Forest
single_tree = rf_classifier.estimators_[0]

# Plot the tree
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plot_tree(single_tree, 
          feature_names=X.columns, 
          class_names=['Not Churn', 'Churn'],
          filled=True, 
          rounded=True, 
          max_depth=3)  # Limiting depth for visibility
plt.show()

# Print decision path for a single instance
sample_instance = X_test.iloc[0]
decision_path = single_tree.decision_path(sample_instance.values.reshape(1, -1))
print("Decision path for a single instance:")
for node in decision_path.indices:
    if node == single_tree.tree_.children_left[decision_path.indices[0]]:
        print(f"Feature {X.columns[single_tree.tree_.feature[node]]}: <= {single_tree.tree_.threshold[node]:.2f}")
    elif node == single_tree.tree_.children_right[decision_path.indices[0]]:
        print(f"Feature {X.columns[single_tree.tree_.feature[node]]}: > {single_tree.tree_.threshold[node]:.2f}")
```
