## Comparative Analysis of Prominent Neuron Models

Slide 1: Introduction to Neuron Models

Neuron models are mathematical representations of the electrical activity in neurons, enabling the study of neural dynamics and information processing in the brain. This presentation focuses on three prominent neuron models: the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), the Izhikevich, and the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models. We will analyze these models using F-I curves, V-T curves, and predictions of the time to the first spike, implemented in Python with numpy and matplotlib libraries.

Slide 2: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Model

The LIF model is a simple yet effective model that describes the dynamics of a neuron's membrane potential. It captures the leaky nature of the membrane and the integration of incoming currents, leading to a spike when the potential reaches a threshold.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# LIF model parameters
tau = 10  # Membrane time constant (ms)
R = 10    # Membrane resistance (MOhm)
Vth = 20  # Spike threshold (mV)
Vr = 0    # Reset potential (mV)

# Input current
I = 20  # (pA)

# Time step
dt = 0.1  # (ms)

# Initialize membrane potential
V = 0

# Simulate LIF model
t_max = 100  # Total simulation time (ms)
t = np.arange(0, t_max, dt)
V_trace = []

for t_step in t:
    dV = (-(V - Vr) + R * I) / tau
    V += dV * dt
    if V >= Vth:
        V = Vr
    V_trace.append(V)
```

Slide 3: Izhikevich Model

The Izhikevich model is a relatively simple spiking neuron model that can exhibit various firing patterns observed in biological neurons. It uses two coupled differential equations to describe the membrane potential and a recovery variable.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Izhikevich model parameters
a = 0.02
b = 0.2
c = -65
d = 8

# Input current
I = 10

# Time step
dt = 0.1

# Initialize membrane potential and recovery variable
v = -70
u = b * v

# Simulate Izhikevich model
t_max = 100  # Total simulation time (ms)
t = np.arange(0, t_max, dt)
v_trace = []
u_trace = []

for t_step in t:
    dv = 0.04 * v ** 2 + 5 * v + 140 - u + I
    du = a * (b * v - u)
    v += dv * dt
    u += du * dt
    if v >= 30:
        v = c
        u += d
    v_trace.append(v)
    u_trace.append(u)

# Plot membrane potential trace
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, v_trace)
plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Membrane Potential (mV)')
plt.title('Izhikevich Model')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) Model

The HH model is a detailed model that describes the ionic mechanisms underlying action potential generation in neurons. It involves four coupled differential equations representing the membrane potential and the gating variables for sodium and potassium ion channels.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# HH model parameters
C = 1    # Membrane capacitance (uF/cm^2)
gNa = 120  # Maximum sodium conductance (mS/cm^2)
gK = 36    # Maximum potassium conductance (mS/cm^2)
gL = 0.3   # Leak conductance (mS/cm^2)
ENa = 50   # Sodium reversal potential (mV)
EK = -77   # Potassium reversal potential (mV)
EL = -54.4 # Leak reversal potential (mV)

# Input current
I = 10  # (uA/cm^2)

# Time step
dt = 0.01  # (ms)

# Initialize state variables
V = -65  # Membrane potential (mV)
m = 0.05 # Sodium activation
h = 0.6  # Sodium inactivation
n = 0.32 # Potassium activation

# Simulate HH model
t_max = 20  # Total simulation time (ms)
t = np.arange(0, t_max, dt)
V_trace = []

for t_step in t:
    # Compute gating variable rates
    am = 0.1 * (25 - V) / (np.exp((25 - V) / 10) - 1)
    bm = 4 * np.exp(-V / 18)
    ah = 0.07 * np.exp(-V / 20)
    bh = 1 / (np.exp((30 - V) / 10) + 1)
    an = 0.01 * (10 - V) / (np.exp((10 - V) / 10) - 1)
    bn = 0.125 * np.exp(-V / 80)

    # Update gating variables
    m += dt * (am * (1 - m) - bm * m)
    h += dt * (ah * (1 - h) - bh * h)
    n += dt * (an * (1 - n) - bn * n)

    # Compute ionic currents
    INa = gNa * m ** 3 * h * (V - ENa)
    IK = gK * n ** 4 * (V - EK)
    IL = gL * (V - EL)

    # Update membrane potential
    dV = (I - INa - IK - IL) / C
    V += dV * dt

    V_trace.append(V)

# Plot membrane potential trace
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, V_trace)
plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Membrane Potential (mV)')
plt.title('Hodgkin-Huxley Model')
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: F-I Curves

F-I curves (frequency-current curves) describe the relationship between the input current and the firing rate of a neuron model. They provide insights into the model's excitability and can be used to compare different neuron models.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# LIF model parameters
tau = 10
R = 10
Vth = 20
Vr = 0

# Input currents
I_range = np.arange(0, 30, 2)  # (pA)

# Simulation time
t_max = 1000  # (ms)
dt = 0.1  # (ms)

# Initialize arrays
firing_rates = []

# Simulate LIF model for different input currents
for I in I_range:
    spikes = 0
    V = 0

    for t in np.arange(0, t_max, dt):
        dV = (-(V - Vr) + R * I) / tau
        V += dV * dt
        if V >= Vth:
            V = Vr
            spikes += 1

    firing_rate = spikes * 1000 / t_max  # Convert to Hz
    firing_rates.append(firing_rate)

# Plot F-I curve
plt.figure()
plt.plot(I_range, firing_rates)
plt.xlabel('Input Current (pA)')
plt.ylabel('Firing Rate (Hz)')
plt.title('F-I Curve (LIF Model)')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: V-T Curves

V-T curves (voltage-time curves) show the temporal evolution of the membrane potential in response to a constant input current. They provide insights into the spiking dynamics and can be used to compare different neuron models.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Izhikevich model parameters
a = 0.02
b = 0.2
c = -65
d = 8

# Input current
I = 10

# Time step
dt = 0.1

# Initialize membrane potential and recovery variable
v = -70
u = b * v

# Simulate Izhikevich model
t_max = 100  # Total simulation time (ms)
t = np.arange(0, t_max, dt)
v_trace = []
u_trace = []

for t_step in t:
    dv = 0.04 * v ** 2 + 5 * v + 140 - u + I
    du = a * (b * v - u)
    v += dv * dt
    u += du * dt
    if v >= 30:
        v = c
        u += d
    v_trace.append(v)
    u_trace.append(u)

# Plot V-T curve
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, v_trace)
plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Membrane Potential (mV)')
plt.title('V-T Curve (Izhikevich Model)')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Time to First Spike

The time to the first spike is an important metric that quantifies the neuron model's response to a constant input current. It provides insights into the model's excitability and can be used to compare different neuron models.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# HH model parameters
C = 1
gNa = 120
gK = 36
gL = 0.3
ENa = 50
EK = -77
EL = -54.4

# Input current
I = 10  # (uA/cm^2)

# Time step
dt = 0.01  # (ms)

# Initialize state variables
V = -65
m = 0.05
h = 0.6
n = 0.32

# Simulate HH model until first spike
t = 0
while True:
    # Compute gating variable rates
    am = 0.1 * (25 - V) / (np.exp((25 - V) / 10) - 1)
    bm = 4 * np.exp(-V / 18)
    ah = 0.07 * np.exp(-V / 20)
    bh = 1 / (np.exp((30 - V) / 10) + 1)
    an = 0.01 * (10 - V) / (np.exp((10 - V) / 10) - 1)
    bn = 0.125 * np.exp(-V / 80)

    # Update gating variables
    m += dt * (am * (1 - m) - bm * m)
    h += dt * (ah * (1 - h) - bh * h)
    n += dt * (an * (1 - n) - bn * n)

    # Compute ionic currents
    INa = gNa * m ** 3 * h * (V - ENa)
    IK = gK * n ** 4 * (V - EK)
    IL = gL * (V - EL)

    # Update membrane potential
    dV = (I - INa - IK - IL) / C
    V += dV * dt

    # Check for spike
    if V >= 0:
        break

    t += dt

print(f"Time to first spike: {t:.2f} ms")
```
