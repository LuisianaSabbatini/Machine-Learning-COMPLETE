## Math Foundations for Machine Learning

Slide 1: Machine Learning vs Statistics

Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields that deal with data analysis and prediction. While statistics focuses on inferring population parameters from sample data, machine learning emphasizes building models that can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Machine learning often employs statistical techniques but extends them with more complex algorithms and computational approaches.

Slide 2: Source Code for Machine Learning vs Statistics

```python
import random

# Generate sample data
data = [random.gauss(0, 1) for _ in range(1000)]

# Statistical approach: Calculate mean and standard deviation
mean = sum(data) / len(data)
std_dev = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5

print(f"Statistical analysis:")
print(f"Mean: {mean:.2f}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}")

# Machine Learning approach: Simple linear regression
X = [[i] for i in range(len(data))]
y = data

def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m, b = 0, 0
    for _ in range(iterations):
        y_pred = [m * x[0] + b for x in X]
        error = sum((y_pred[i] - y[i]) ** 2 for i in range(len(y))) / len(y)
        m_gradient = sum(2 * X[i][0] * (y_pred[i] - y[i]) for i in range(len(y))) / len(y)
        b_gradient = sum(2 * (y_pred[i] - y[i]) for i in range(len(y))) / len(y)
        m -= learning_rate * m_gradient
        b -= learning_rate * b_gradient
    return m, b

m, b = gradient_descent(X, y)

print(f"\nMachine Learning analysis:")
print(f"Linear Regression: y = {m:.4f}x + {b:.4f}")
```

```

Slide 4: Generative vs Discriminative Models

Generative models learn the joint probability distribution P(X, Y) of inputs X and labels Y, allowing them to generate new data points. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning the conditional probability P(Y|X), directly modeling the decision boundary between classes. While generative models can be more flexible, discriminative models often perform better in classification tasks with limited data.

Slide 5: Source Code for Generative vs Discriminative Models

```python
import random
import math

# Generate sample data
def generate_data(n_samples, mean, std_dev):
    return [random.gauss(mean, std_dev) for _ in range(n_samples)]

class_a = generate_data(1000, 0, 1)
class_b = generate_data(1000, 2, 1)

# Generative Model: Gaussian Naive Bayes
def gaussian_pdf(x, mean, std_dev):
    return (1 / (std_dev * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(-((x - mean) ** 2) / (2 * std_dev ** 2))

mean_a, std_dev_a = sum(class_a) / len(class_a), (sum((x - sum(class_a) / len(class_a)) ** 2 for x in class_a) / len(class_a)) ** 0.5
mean_b, std_dev_b = sum(class_b) / len(class_b), (sum((x - sum(class_b) / len(class_b)) ** 2 for x in class_b) / len(class_b)) ** 0.5

def generative_model(x):
    p_a = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_a, std_dev_a)
    p_b = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_b, std_dev_b)
    return "A" if p_a > p_b else "B"

# Discriminative Model: Logistic Regression
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))

def train_logistic_regression(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    w, b = 0, 0
    for _ in range(iterations):
        for i in range(len(X)):
            y_pred = sigmoid(w * X[i] + b)
            w -= learning_rate * (y_pred - y[i]) * X[i]
            b -= learning_rate * (y_pred - y[i])
    return w, b

X = class_a + class_b
y = [0] * len(class_a) + [1] * len(class_b)
w, b = train_logistic_regression(X, y)

def discriminative_model(x):
    return "A" if sigmoid(w * x + b) < 0.5 else "B"

# Test both models
test_point = 1.5
print(f"Generative model prediction: {generative_model(test_point)}")
print(f"Discriminative model prediction: {discriminative_model(test_point)}")
```

Slide 7: Bayes Classifier and Empirical Risk Minimization

The Bayes classifier is the optimal classifier that minimizes the probability of misclassification. It assigns each input to the class with the highest posterior probability. Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a principle used to find a function that minimizes the average loss on the training data. While the Bayes classifier is theoretically optimal, ERM provides a practical approach to finding good classifiers in real-world scenarios.

Slide 8: Source Code for Bayes Classifier and Empirical Risk Minimization

```python
import random
import math

def generate_data(n_samples, mean, std_dev):
    return [(random.gauss(mean, std_dev), 0) for _ in range(n_samples)] + \

def gaussian_pdf(x, mean, std_dev):
    return (1 / (std_dev * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(-((x - mean) ** 2) / (2 * std_dev ** 2))

class_0 = [x for x, y in data if y == 0]
class_1 = [x for x, y in data if y == 1]

mean_0, std_dev_0 = sum(class_0) / len(class_0), (sum((x - sum(class_0) / len(class_0)) ** 2 for x in class_0) / len(class_0)) ** 0.5
mean_1, std_dev_1 = sum(class_1) / len(class_1), (sum((x - sum(class_1) / len(class_1)) ** 2 for x in class_1) / len(class_1)) ** 0.5

def bayes_classifier(x):
    p_0 = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_0, std_dev_0) * 0.5  # Assuming equal priors
    p_1 = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_1, std_dev_1) * 0.5
    return 0 if p_0 > p_1 else 1

# Empirical Risk Minimization (using logistic regression)
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))

def logistic_loss(y_true, y_pred):

        for i in range(len(X)):
            y_pred = sigmoid(w * X[i] + b)
            total_loss += logistic_loss(y[i], y_pred)
            w -= learning_rate * (y_pred - y[i]) * X[i]
            b -= learning_rate * (y_pred - y[i])
        if _ % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Iteration {_}, Average Loss: {total_loss / len(X):.4f}")
    return w, b

X, y = zip(*data)
w, b = train_logistic_regression(X, y)

def erm_classifier(x):
    return 0 if sigmoid(w * x + b) < 0.5 else 1

# Test both classifiers
test_point = 1.0
print(f"Bayes Classifier prediction: {bayes_classifier(test_point)}")
print(f"ERM Classifier prediction: {erm_classifier(test_point)}")
```

Slide 10: Concentration Inequalities and Noise Conditions

Concentration inequalities provide bounds on how random variables deviate from their expected values. These inequalities are crucial in machine learning for understanding the generalization capabilities of algorithms. Noise conditions describe the inherent randomness or uncertainty in the data. Together, they help us analyze the robustness and reliability of machine learning models in the presence of randomness and noise.

Slide 11: Source Code for Concentration Inequalities and Noise Conditions

import random
import math

def generate_noisy_data(n_samples, true_mean, noise_std):
    return [true_mean + random.
```

Slide 12: Statistical Learning Theory and Binary Classification

Statistical Learning Theory provides a framework for analyzing the performance of machine learning algorithms. It focuses on understanding the relationship between the complexity of the hypothesis space, the amount of training data, and the generalization error. Binary classification, a fundamental problem in machine learning, involves assigning input data to one of two classes. The theory helps us understand the limits of learning and guides the design of algorithms with good generalization properties.

Slide 13: Source Code for Statistical Learning Theory and Binary Classification

```python
import random
import math

def generate_data(n_samples, noise=0.1):
    X = [(random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1)) for _ in range(n_samples)]
    y = [1 if x[0] + x[1] + random.gauss(0, noise) > 0 else -1 for x in X]
    return X, y

        for i in range(len(X)):
            if y[i] * (w[0]*X[i][0] + w[1]*X[i][1] + b) <= 0:
                w[0] += y[i] * X[i][0]
                w[1] += y[i] * X[i][1]
                b += y[i]
                misclassified += 1
        if misclassified == 0:
            break
    return w, b

def estimate_generalization_error(w, b, test_X, test_y):
    errors = sum(1 for x, y in zip(test_X, test_y) if y * (w[0]*x[0] + w[1]*x[1] + b) <= 0)
    return errors / len(test_y)

# Generate training and test data
train_X, train_y = generate_data(1000)
test_X, test_y = generate_data(200)

print(f"Estimated generalization error: {gen_error:.4f}")
```

Slide 15: Estimation, Approximation, and No-Free-Lunch Theorems

Estimation and approximation are fundamental concepts in machine learning. Estimation involves inferring parameters or functions from data, while approximation deals with how well a model can represent the true underlying function. The No-Free-Lunch theorems state that no single algorithm can outperform all others across all possible problems, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms for specific tasks.

Slide 18: Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Theory and Rademacher Complexity

VC theory provides a framework for measuring the capacity of a hypothesis class in statistical learning theory. The VC dimension of a hypothesis class is a measure of its complexity and is used to bound the generalization error of learning algorithms. Rademacher complexity is another measure of the richness of a hypothesis class, which can provide tighter bounds on the generalization error in some cases.
