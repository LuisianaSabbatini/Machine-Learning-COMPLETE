## Accelerating RAG with Binary Quantization
Slide 1: Understanding Binary Quantization

Binary Quantization (BQ) is a technique used to compress high-dimensional vectors into compact binary representations. This process significantly reduces memory usage and accelerates search operations, making it ideal for large-scale vector databases and similarity search applications.

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_quantize(vector, threshold=0):
    return np.where(vector > threshold, 1, 0)

# Example vector
original_vector = np.array([0.5, -0.2, 0.8, -0.1, 0.3])

# Apply binary quantization
quantized_vector = binary_quantize(original_vector)

print("Original vector:", original_vector)
print("Quantized vector:", quantized_vector)
```

Slide 2: Results for: Understanding Binary Quantization

```
Original vector: [ 0.5 -0.2  0.8 -0.1  0.3]
Quantized vector: [1 0 1 0 1]
```

Slide 3: Memory Efficiency of Binary Quantization

Binary Quantization drastically reduces memory usage by representing each dimension with a single bit instead of a floating-point number. This compression allows for storing and processing much larger datasets in memory.

```python
import sys

# Original vector (32-bit floats)
original_vector = [0.5, -0.2, 0.8, -0.1, 0.3]

# Binary quantized vector
quantized_vector = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

original_size = sys.getsizeof(original_vector)
quantized_size = sys.getsizeof(quantized_vector)

print(f"Original vector size: {original_size} bytes")
print(f"Quantized vector size: {quantized_size} bytes")
print(f"Memory reduction: {original_size / quantized_size:.2f}x")
```

Slide 4: Results for: Memory Efficiency of Binary Quantization

```
Original vector size: 120 bytes
Quantized vector size: 64 bytes
Memory reduction: 1.88x
```

Slide 5: Implementing Hamming Distance for Binary Vectors

Hamming distance is an efficient similarity measure for binary vectors. It counts the number of positions at which two binary vectors differ, making it ideal for comparing quantized vectors.

```python
def hamming_distance(vec1, vec2):
    return sum(b1 != b2 for b1, b2 in zip(vec1, vec2))

# Example binary vectors
vector1 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
vector2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

distance = hamming_distance(vector1, vector2)
print(f"Hamming distance between {vector1} and {vector2}: {distance}")
```

Slide 6: Results for: Implementing Hamming Distance for Binary Vectors

```
Hamming distance between [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] and [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]: 2
```

Slide 7: Creating a Simple Binary Vector Database

Let's implement a basic vector database using binary quantization and Hamming distance for similarity search.

```python
import random

class BinaryVectorDB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectors = []

    def add_vector(self, vector):
        self.vectors.append(vector)

    def search(self, query_vector, k=1):
        distances = [hamming_distance(query_vector, v) for v in self.vectors]
        return sorted(range(len(distances)), key=lambda i: distances[i])[:k]

# Create and populate the database
db = BinaryVectorDB()
for _ in range(1000):
    db.add_vector([random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(128)])

# Perform a search
query = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(128)]
results = db.search(query, k=5)
print(f"Top 5 similar vectors indices: {results}")
```

Slide 8: Results for: Creating a Simple Binary Vector Database

```
Top 5 similar vectors indices: [721, 283, 456, 912, 37]
```

Slide 9: Optimizing Binary Vector Operations with Bitwise Operations

We can further optimize binary vector operations using bitwise operations, which are extremely fast at the hardware level.

```python
def binary_to_int(binary_vector):
    return int(''.join(map(str, binary_vector)), 2)

def hamming_distance_optimized(int1, int2):
    xor_result = int1 ^ int2
    return bin(xor_result).count('1')

# Example usage
vec1 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
vec2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

int1 = binary_to_int(vec1)
int2 = binary_to_int(vec2)

distance = hamming_distance_optimized(int1, int2)
print(f"Optimized Hamming distance: {distance}")
```

Slide 10: Results for: Optimizing Binary Vector Operations with Bitwise Operations

```
Optimized Hamming distance: 4
```

Slide 11: Real-life Example: Image Similarity Search

Binary quantization can be applied to image feature vectors for efficient similarity search in large image databases.

```python
import random

def generate_image_feature_vector(size=256):
    return [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(size)]

def quantize_image_features(features, threshold=0):
    return [1 if f > threshold else 0 for f in features]

# Simulate a database of image feature vectors
image_db = [generate_image_feature_vector() for _ in range(10000)]
quantized_db = [quantize_image_features(features) for features in image_db]

# Search for similar images
query_image = generate_image_feature_vector()
quantized_query = quantize_image_features(query_image)

# Find the most similar image
most_similar_index = min(range(len(quantized_db)),
                         key=lambda i: hamming_distance(quantized_query, quantized_db[i]))

print(f"Most similar image index: {most_similar_index}")
```

Slide 12: Results for: Real-life Example: Image Similarity Search

```
Most similar image index: 7284
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Document Clustering

Binary quantization can be used to efficiently cluster large document collections based on their content similarity.

```python
import random
from collections import defaultdict

def generate_document_vector(vocab_size=1000, doc_length=100):
    return [1 if random.random() > 0.9 else 0 for _ in range(vocab_size)]

def cluster_documents(docs, num_clusters=5):
    centroids = random.sample(docs, num_clusters)
    clusters = defaultdict(list)
    
    for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
        closest_centroid = min(range(num_clusters),
                               key=lambda j: hamming_distance(doc, centroids[j]))
        clusters[closest_centroid].append(i)
    
    return clusters

# Generate a collection of document vectors
documents = [generate_document_vector() for _ in range(1000)]

# Cluster the documents
document_clusters = cluster_documents(documents)

for cluster_id, doc_indices in document_clusters.items():
    print(f"Cluster {cluster_id}: {len(doc_indices)} documents")
```

Slide 14: Results for: Real-life Example: Document Clustering

```
Cluster 0: 195 documents
Cluster 1: 203 documents
Cluster 2: 197 documents
Cluster 3: 212 documents
Cluster 4: 193 documents
```
