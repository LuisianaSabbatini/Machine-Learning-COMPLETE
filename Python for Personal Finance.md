## Python for Personal Finance

Slide 1 Python for Personal Finance

Slide 2 Introduction Python is a powerful tool for managing personal finances. This presentation covers various Python applications for budgeting, investment analysis, loan calculations, retirement planning, tax calculations, credit score analysis, and optimizing savings strategies.

Slide 3: Creating a Budget Template Python can create a simple budget template to track income and expenses. Code Example:

```python
income = float(input("Enter your monthly income: "))
expenses = []
num_expenses = int(input("How many expenses do you have? "))
for i in range(num_expenses):
    expense = float(input(f"Enter expense {i+1}: "))
    expenses.append(expense)

total_expenses = sum(expenses)
remaining_budget = income - total_expenses

print(f"Total Expenses: ${total_expenses:.2f}")
print(f"Remaining Budget: ${remaining_budget:.2f}")
```

Slide 4: Tracking Expenses Python can help track expenses by categorizing them and generating reports. Code Example:

```python
expenses = {
    "Rent": 1000,
    "Utilities": 200,
    "Groceries": 500,
    "Transportation": 150,
    "Entertainment": 100
}

total_expenses = sum(expenses.values())
print(f"Total Expenses: ${total_expenses}")

for category, amount in expenses.items():
    print(f"{category}: ${amount}")
```

Slide 5: Personal Investment Analysis Python can analyze investment portfolios, calculate returns, and visualize performance. Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load investment data
portfolio = pd.read_csv("portfolio.csv")

# Calculate returns
portfolio["Return"] = portfolio["Close"].pct_change()

# Plot investment performance
portfolio["Close"].plot()
plt.title("Investment Performance")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Price")
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Risk Assessment Python can help assess investment risk by calculating volatility and other risk metrics. Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load investment data
portfolio = pd.read_csv("portfolio.csv")

# Calculate daily returns
returns = portfolio["Close"].pct_change()

# Calculate volatility (standard deviation of returns)
volatility = returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized volatility

print(f"Volatility: {volatility:.2%}")
```

Slide 7: Portfolio Optimization Python can optimize investment portfolios using techniques like Modern Portfolio Theory. Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pypfopt import EfficientFrontier

# Load investment data
portfolio = pd.read_csv("portfolio.csv")
returns = portfolio["Close"].pct_change().dropna()

# Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix
mu = returns.mean()
Sigma = returns.cov()

# Optimize portfolio
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, Sigma)
weights = ef.max_sharpe()
cleaned_weights = ef.clean_weights()

print("Optimized Portfolio Weights:")
print(cleaned_weights)
```

Slide 8: Loan and Mortgage Calculators Python can calculate loan and mortgage payments, amortization schedules, and more. Code Example:

```python
loan_amount = 200000
interest_rate = 0.05
loan_term = 30  # years

# Calculate monthly payment
monthly_rate = interest_rate / 12
num_payments = loan_term * 12
monthly_payment = (loan_amount * monthly_rate) / (1 - (1 + monthly_rate) ** (-num_payments))

print(f"Monthly Payment: ${monthly_payment:.2f}")
```

Slide 9: Retirement Planning Models Python can model retirement savings, project future values, and estimate retirement income needs. Code Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Inputs
current_age = 30
retirement_age = 65
initial_savings = 50000
monthly_contribution = 500
annual_return = 0.07

# Calculate future value of savings
years_to_retirement = retirement_age - current_age
future_value = np.fv(annual_return / 12, years_to_retirement * 12, -monthly_contribution, -initial_savings)

print(f"Projected Retirement Savings: ${future_value:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Basic Tax Calculator Python can estimate tax liabilities based on income and deductions. Code Example:

```python
income = 75000
standard_deduction = 12000
tax_brackets = [
    (0, 0.1),
    (9875, 0.12),
    (40125, 0.22),
    (85525, 0.24),
    (163300, 0.32),
    (207350, 0.35),
    (518400, 0.37)
]

taxable_income = income - standard_deduction
tax_liability = 0

for bracket_limit, tax_rate in tax_brackets:
    if taxable_income > bracket_limit:
        tax_liability += (min(taxable_income, bracket_limit) - bracket_limit) * tax_rate
    else:
        tax_liability += taxable_income * tax_rate
        break

print(f"Estimated Tax Liability: ${tax_liability:.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Credit Score Analysis Python can analyze credit report data, identify factors affecting credit scores, and suggest improvements. Code Example:

```python
# Credit report data
credit_report = {
    "Payment History": 0.9,
    "Credit Utilization": 0.3,
    "Length of Credit History": 5,
    "Credit Mix": 3,
    "New Credit Inquiries": 2
}

# Calculate credit score
credit_score = 500
credit_score += credit_report["Payment History"] * 100
credit_score -= credit_report["Credit Utilization"] * 200
credit_score += credit_report["Length of Credit History"] * 20
credit_score += credit_report["Credit Mix"] * 10
credit_score -= credit_report["New Credit Inquiries"] * 5

print(f"Estimated Credit Score: {credit_score}")
```

Slide 12: Optimizing Savings Strategies Python can analyze different savings strategies and optimize them based on goals and constraints. Code Example:

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Inputs
income = 5000
expenses = 3000
current_savings = 10000
goal = 100000
time_horizon = 10  # years

# Define objective function
def savings_objective(x):
    savings_rate = x[0]
    monthly_contribution = income * savings_rate - expenses
    future_value = np.fv(0.07 / 12, time_horizon * 12, -monthly_contribution, -current_savings)
    return abs(future_value - goal)

# Optimize savings rate
initial_guess = 0.1
result = minimize(savings_objective, initial_guess, bounds=[(0, 1)])
optimal_savings_rate = result.x[0]

print(f"Optimal Savings Rate: {optimal_savings_rate * 100:.2f}%")
```

Slide 13: Debt Management Python can help manage and optimize debt repayment strategies, such as the debt avalanche or debt snowball methods. Code Example:

```python
debts = [
    {"name": "Credit Card 1", "balance": 5000, "interest_rate": 0.18, "minimum_payment": 100},
    {"name": "Student Loan", "balance": 20000, "interest_rate": 0.06, "minimum_payment": 200},
    {"name": "Credit Card 2", "balance": 3000, "interest_rate": 0.22, "minimum_payment": 75}
]

# Sort debts by interest rate (debt avalanche method)
debts.sort(key=lambda x: x["interest_rate"], reverse=True)

# Debt repayment plan
total_minimum_payment = sum(debt["minimum_payment"] for debt in debts)
monthly_payment = 1500

for debt in debts:
    print(f"Paying off {debt['name']} with ${debt['balance']:.2f} balance at {debt['interest_rate']:.2%} interest rate.")
    
    while debt["balance"] > 0:
        interest = debt["balance"] * debt["interest_rate"] / 12
        payment = max(monthly_payment - total_minimum_payment + debt["minimum_payment"], debt["minimum_payment"])
        principal_payment = payment - interest
        debt["balance"] -= principal_payment
        print(f"Payment: ${payment:.2f}, Principal: ${principal_payment:.2f}, Remaining Balance: ${debt['balance']:.2f}")
        
    total_minimum_payment -= debt["minimum_payment"]
    print(f"{debt['name']} paid off!\n")
```
