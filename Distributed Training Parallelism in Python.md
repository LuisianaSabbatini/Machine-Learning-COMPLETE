## Distributed Training Parallelism in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Distributed Training Parallelism

Distributed training parallelism is a technique used to accelerate the training of large neural networks by distributing the workload across multiple devices or machines. This approach allows for faster training times and the ability to handle larger models and datasets. In this presentation, we'll explore four main types of parallelism: Data, Model, Pipeline, and Tensor.

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def init_distributed():
    dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
    torch.cuda.set_device(dist.get_rank())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    mp.spawn(init_distributed, nprocs=torch.cuda.device_count())
```

Slide 2: Data Parallelism

Data parallelism is the most common form of distributed training. It involves splitting the input data across multiple devices, with each device having a  of the entire model. The gradients are then aggregated across all devices to update the model parameters.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleModel().cuda()
model = DDP(model, device_ids=[dist.get_rank()])
```

Slide 3: Data Parallelism in Action

Let's see how data parallelism works in practice with a simple training loop.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

def train(model, dataloader, optimizer, epochs):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            inputs, targets = batch
            inputs, targets = inputs.cuda(), targets.cuda()
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, targets)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
train(model, dataloader, optimizer, epochs=5)
```

Slide 4: Model Parallelism

Model parallelism splits the model across multiple devices, with each device responsible for a portion of the model's layers. This approach is useful when the model is too large to fit on a single device's memory.

```python
class LargeModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(1000, 2000).to('cuda:0')
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(2000, 500).to('cuda:1')

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.to('cuda:0')
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = x.to('cuda:1')
        return self.layer2(x)

model = LargeModel()
```

Slide 5: Pipeline Parallelism

Pipeline parallelism divides the model into stages, with each stage assigned to a different device. Data flows through the pipeline, allowing for concurrent processing of multiple batches at different stages.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.distributed.pipeline.sync import Pipe

class PipelineModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.seq = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(100, 200),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(200, 300),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(300, 10)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.seq(x)

model = PipelineModel()
model = Pipe(model, chunks=8)
```

Slide 6: Pipeline Parallelism in Action

Let's see how to use pipeline parallelism in a training loop.

```python
def train_pipeline(model, dataloader, optimizer, epochs):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            inputs, targets = batch
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(outputs, targets)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
train_pipeline(model, dataloader, optimizer, epochs=5)
```

Slide 7: Tensor Parallelism

Tensor parallelism splits individual tensors across multiple devices, allowing for parallel computation on different parts of the same tensor. This approach is particularly useful for very large models with enormous parameter counts.

```python
import torch.distributed as dist

class TensorParallelLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features))
        
        # Split weight and bias across devices
        self.weight = torch.chunk(self.weight, dist.get_world_size(), dim=0)[dist.get_rank()]
        self.bias = torch.chunk(self.bias, dist.get_world_size(), dim=0)[dist.get_rank()]

    def forward(self, x):
        local_out = F.linear(x, self.weight, self.bias)
        gathered_out = [torch.zeros_like(local_out) for _ in range(dist.get_world_size())]
        dist.all_gather(gathered_out, local_out)
        return torch.cat(gathered_out, dim=-1)
```

Slide 8: Combining Parallelism Techniques

In practice, it's common to combine multiple parallelism techniques to achieve the best performance. Here's an example of combining data and model parallelism:

```python
class CombinedParallelModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(1000, 2000).to('cuda:0')
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(2000, 500).to('cuda:1')

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.to('cuda:0')
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = x.to('cuda:1')
        return self.layer2(x)

model = CombinedParallelModel()
model = DDP(model, device_ids=[dist.get_rank()])
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Let's consider a real-life example of using distributed training for image classification using a ResNet model.

```python
import torchvision.models as models
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

def train_image_classifier(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)

    model = models.resnet50(pretrained=False).cuda()
    model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])

    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    ])

    dataset = ImageFolder(root='path/to/dataset', transform=transform)
    sampler = DistributedSampler(dataset)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, sampler=sampler)

    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

    for epoch in range(10):
        for inputs, labels in dataloader:
            inputs, labels = inputs.cuda(), labels.cuda()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(train_image_classifier, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size)
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Natural Language Processing

Another real-life example is using distributed training for a large language model in natural language processing tasks.

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

def train_bert_classifier(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)

    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased').cuda()
    model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])

    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

    # Assume we have a list of texts and labels
    texts = ["This is a positive review", "This is a negative review"]
    labels = [1, 0]

    encoded = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
    dataset = TensorDataset(encoded['input_ids'], encoded['attention_mask'], torch.tensor(labels))
    sampler = DistributedSampler(dataset)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, sampler=sampler)

    optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

    for epoch in range(3):
        for batch in dataloader:
            input_ids, attention_mask, labels = [b.cuda() for b in batch]
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
            loss = outputs.loss
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(train_bert_classifier, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size)
```

Slide 11: Challenges and Considerations

While distributed training parallelism offers significant benefits, it also comes with challenges:

1. Communication overhead: Frequent synchronization between devices can slow down training.
2. Load balancing: Ensuring even distribution of work across devices is crucial for efficiency.
3. Memory management: Careful memory allocation is needed to avoid out-of-memory errors.
4. Debugging complexity: Distributed systems can be more challenging to debug than single-device setups.

To address these challenges, consider using techniques like gradient accumulation, mixed-precision training, and efficient communication protocols.

```python
# Example of gradient accumulation
accumulation_steps = 4
optimizer.zero_grad()
for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss = loss / accumulation_steps
    loss.backward()
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

Slide 12: Best Practices for Distributed Training

To make the most of distributed training parallelism, consider these best practices:

1. Choose the right parallelism strategy based on your model size and available hardware.
2. Use efficient data loading techniques, such as prefetching and caching.
3. Implement proper error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms.
4. Monitor and optimize communication patterns between devices.
5. Regularly benchmark and profile your distributed training setup.

```python
# Example of efficient data loading with prefetching
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)

# Example of monitoring GPU utilization
import gpustat

def monitor_gpus():
    gpus = gpustat.GPUStatCollection.new_query()
    for gpu in gpus:
        print(f"GPU {gpu.index}: {gpu.memory_used}MB / {gpu.memory_total}MB")

# Call monitor_gpus() periodically during training
```

Slide 13: Future Directions and Advanced Techniques

The field of distributed training parallelism is rapidly evolving. Some advanced techniques and future directions include:

1. Automated parallelism strategies
2. Dynamic load balancing
3. Heterogeneous device support
4. Federated learning for privacy-preserving distributed training
5. Integration with cloud and edge computing platforms

Researchers and practitioners continue to develop new methods to improve the efficiency and scalability of distributed training.

```python
# Example of a simple federated learning setup
def federated_average(models):
    global_model = models[0]
    for param in global_model.parameters():
        param.data = torch.stack([model.state_dict()[param.data] for model in models]).mean(dim=0)
    return global_model

# Simulate federated learning with 3 clients
client_models = [create_model() for _ in range(3)]
for round in range(10):
    # Train client models independently
    for model in client_models:
        train(model, client_data)
    
    # Aggregate models
    global_model = federated_average(client_models)
    
    # Update client models
    for model in client_models:
        model.load_state_dict(global_model.state_dict())
```
