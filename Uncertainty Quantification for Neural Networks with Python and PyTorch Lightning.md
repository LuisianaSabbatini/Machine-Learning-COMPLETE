## Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Networks with Python and PyTorch Lightning

Slide 1: Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of quantifying and characterizing the uncertainties associated with computational models, input data, and model predictions. In the context of neural networks, UQ can help understand the reliability and confidence of the model's outputs, which is crucial in many applications, such as decision-making systems, safety-critical systems, and scientific simulations.

Slide 2: PyTorch Lightning UQ Box

PyTorch Lightning UQ Box is a lightweight library built on top of PyTorch Lightning that provides a unified interface for uncertainty quantification in deep learning models. It supports various UQ methods, including Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and evidential deep learning.

```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.plugins.environments import SeedEnvironment

class UQModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self, model, likelihood):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = model
        self.likelihood = likelihood

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # Training step implementation
        ...

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # Validation step implementation
        ...
```

Slide 3: Monte Carlo Dropout

Monte Carlo dropout is a technique for approximating Bayesian inference in neural networks by using dropout at inference time. It allows for estimating the model's predictive uncertainty by making multiple stochastic forward passes through the network and analyzing the variations in the outputs.

```python
from pytorch_lightning.utilities.model_utils import apply_dropout

class MCDropoutModel(UQModel):
    def forward(self, x, num_samples=10):
        preds = [apply_dropout(self.model, x, 0.2) for _ in range(num_samples)]
        return preds

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        preds = self.forward(x, num_samples=10)
        # Calculate uncertainty metrics
        ...
```

Slide 4: Deep Ensembles

Deep ensembles is a technique that involves training multiple independent neural networks on the same task and combining their predictions during inference. This approach can capture different modes of the data distribution and provide a more robust and accurate estimate of the model's uncertainty.

```python
from pytorch_lightning.utilities.model_utils import apply_dropout

class EnsembleModel(UQModel):
    def __init__(self, models):
        super().__init__(models[0], None)
        self.models = models

    def forward(self, x):
        preds = [model(x) for model in self.models]
        return preds

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        preds = self.forward(x)
        # Calculate uncertainty metrics
        ...
```

Slide 5: Evidential Deep Learning

Evidential deep learning is a framework that extends neural networks to output a Dirichlet distribution over the class probabilities, allowing for the estimation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to express its confidence or uncertainty in its predictions.

```python
import evidential_deep_learning as edl

class EvidentialModel(UQModel):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model, edl.EvidentialRegression())

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.likelihood(self.model(x))

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        preds = self.forward(x)
        # Calculate uncertainty metrics
        ...
```

Slide 6: Uncertainty Metrics

PyTorch Lightning UQ Box provides various metrics for quantifying and evaluating the uncertainties in the model's predictions. These metrics include entropy, mutual information, and expected calibration error (ECE).

```python
from uqbox.metrics import entropy, mutual_info, expected_calibration_error

def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
    x, y = batch
    preds = self.forward(x)
    entropy_value = entropy(preds, y)
    mi_value = mutual_info(preds, y)
    ece_value = expected_calibration_error(preds, y)
    self.log("entropy", entropy_value)
    self.log("mutual_info", mi_value)
    self.log("ece", ece_value)
```

Slide 7: Uncertainty-Aware Training

PyTorch Lightning UQ Box allows you to incorporate uncertainty information into the training process, enabling the model to learn to capture and express uncertainties more effectively.

```python
from uqbox.losses import EvidentialRegression, EvidentialClassification

class UncertaintyAwareModel(UQModel):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model, EvidentialRegression())

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        preds = self.forward(x)
        loss = self.likelihood.loss(preds, y)
        self.log("train_loss", loss)
        return loss
```

Slide 8: Active Learning with Uncertainty

Uncertainty information can be leveraged in active learning scenarios, where the model selects the most informative and uncertain samples for annotation, improving data efficiency and model performance.

```python
from uqbox.active_learning import RandomSampler, EntropySampler

def active_learning_loop(model, unlabeled_data, budget):
    sampler = EntropySampler(model)
    labeled_data = []
    for _ in range(budget):
        uncertain_samples = sampler.sample(unlabeled_data)
        # Annotate uncertain_samples
        labeled_data.extend(annotated_samples)
        model.fit(labeled_data)
    return model
```

Slide 9: Out-of-Distribution Detection

Uncertainty quantification can be used for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which are inputs that differ significantly from the training data distribution. This is important for ensuring the model's safety and reliability in real-world applications.

```python
from uqbox.ood import MaxSoftmaxProbability, Entropy

class OODDetector:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.max_softmax = MaxSoftmaxProbability()
        self.entropy = Entropy()

    def detect_ood(self, x):
        preds = self.model(x)
        max_prob = self.max_softmax(preds)
        entropy_value = self.entropy(preds)
        if max_prob < threshold or entropy_value > threshold:
            return True  # OOD sample
        else:
            return False  # In-distribution sample
```

Slide 10: Uncertainty Visualization

PyTorch Lightning UQ Box provides utilities for visualizing the uncertainties in the model's predictions, which can aid in understanding and interpreting the model's behavior.

```python
from uqbox.viz import plot_uncertainty_heatmap

def visualize_uncertainty(model, inputs):
    preds = model(inputs)
    uncertainty_map = uncertainty_metric(preds)
    plot_uncertainty_heatmap(inputs, uncertainty_map)
```

Slide 11: Uncertainty in Regression Tasks

Uncertainty quantification is not limited to classification tasks; it can also be applied to regression problems, where the model predicts continuous values. In this case, the uncertainties can provide valuable information about the confidence intervals and error bounds of the predictions.

```python
from uqbox.models import GaussianRegressor

class RegressionModel(UQModel):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model, GaussianRegressor())

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.likelihood(self.model(x))

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        preds = self.forward(x)
        mean, variance = preds.mean, preds.variance
        # Calculate regression metrics and uncertainties
        ...
```

Slide 12: Uncertainty in Reinforcement Learning

Uncertainty quantification can also be applied to reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, where the agent needs to make decisions based on the current state and learn from the environment. Incorporating uncertainty information can lead to more robust and risk-aware decision-making in RL agents.

```python
import torch
from uqbox.rl import DropoutAgent, EnsembleAgent

class UncertaintyAwareAgent:
    def __init__(self, env, agent_type="dropout"):
        self.env = env
        if agent_type == "dropout":
            self.agent = DropoutAgent(env)
        else:
            self.agent = EnsembleAgent(env)

    def train(self, num_episodes):
        for _ in range(num_episodes):
            state = self.env.reset()
            done = False
            while not done:
                action, uncertainty = self.agent.act(state)
                next_state, reward, done, _ = self.env.step(action)
                self.agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state, done, uncertainty)
                state = next_state
```

Slide 13: Uncertainty in Anomaly Detection

Uncertainty quantification can be leveraged for anomaly detection tasks, where the goal is to identify samples that deviate significantly from the normal or expected patterns. By quantifying the uncertainties, anomalous samples can be detected based on their high uncertainty scores.

```python
from uqbox.models import GaussianAnomaly

class AnomalyDetector(UQModel):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model, GaussianAnomaly())

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.likelihood(self.model(x))

    def detect_anomalies(self, data):
        preds = self.forward(data)
        anomaly_scores = preds.anomaly_score
        threshold = ...  # Set an appropriate threshold
        anomalies = anomaly_scores > threshold
        return anomalies
```
