## Introduction to Topological Deep Learning in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Topological Deep Learning

Topological Deep Learning is an emerging field that combines concepts from topology, a branch of mathematics dealing with the study of shapes and spaces, with deep learning techniques. It aims to incorporate geometric and topological information into neural network models, enabling them to better understand and represent the intrinsic structure of data, particularly in domains where the data has inherent topological properties.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from topological_utils import topological_data_augmentation

# Load and preprocess data
data, labels = load_data()
augmented_data = topological_data_augmentation(data)

# Define a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=augmented_data.shape[1:]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(augmented_data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

Slide 2: The Cellular Transformer (CT)

The Cellular Transformer (CT) is a novel neural network architecture proposed for topological deep learning. It is designed to capture and process topological information in data by incorporating ideas from cellular automata and transformer models. The CT operates on a graph-like structure, where each node represents a feature or data point, and the connections between nodes encode the topological relationships.

Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from cellular_transformer import CellularTransformer

# Define the input data and its topological structure
data = torch.randn(batch_size, num_features)
topology = construct_topology(data)

# Create a Cellular Transformer model
model = CellularTransformer(num_features, num_heads=4, num_layers=6)

# Forward pass through the model
output = model(data, topology)

# Compute loss and optimize the model
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

Slide 3: Topological Data Augmentation

Topological Data Augmentation is a technique used in topological deep learning to generate new training data samples while preserving the topological structure of the original data. This can improve the robustness and generalization performance of the neural network models by exposing them to a wider range of variations in the data while maintaining the underlying topological relationships.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
from topological_utils import topological_data_augmentation

# Load original data
data, labels = load_data()

# Perform topological data augmentation
augmented_data, augmented_labels = topological_data_augmentation(data, labels)

# Train the model with augmented data
model.fit(augmented_data, augmented_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

Slide 4: Persistent Homology and Topological Data Analysis

Persistent Homology is a powerful tool from algebraic topology that can be used to analyze the topological features of data. It provides a way to extract and represent topological information in the form of persistent homology groups and barcodes. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is the application of these techniques to extract insights and patterns from complex data.

Code:

```python
import gudhi
import numpy as np

# Load and preprocess data
data = load_data()

# Compute the persistent homology
alpha_complex = gudhi.AlphaComplex(points=data)
simplex_tree = alpha_complex.create_simplex_tree(max_alpha_square=np.inf)
diag = simplex_tree.persistence()

# Visualize the persistence barcodes
gudhi.plot_persistence_barcodes(diag)
```

Slide 5: Topological Autoencoders

Topological Autoencoders are a class of neural network models that combine the principles of autoencoders with topological concepts. They aim to learn a low-dimensional representation of the input data while preserving its topological structure. This can be useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and anomaly detection.

Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from topological_autoencoder import TopologicalAutoencoder

# Load and preprocess data
data = load_data()

# Create a Topological Autoencoder model
model = TopologicalAutoencoder(input_dim=data.shape[1], encoding_dim=32)

# Train the model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Use the model for dimensionality reduction or visualization
encoded_data = model.encode(data)
```

Slide 6: Topological Reinforcement Learning

Topological Reinforcement Learning is an emerging area that aims to incorporate topological information into reinforcement learning algorithms. By understanding the topological structure of the state space and the environment, reinforcement learning agents can potentially learn more efficient policies and navigate complex environments more effectively.

Code:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
from topological_rl import TopologicalQ_Learning

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Initialize the Topological Q-Learning agent
agent = TopologicalQ_Learning(env.observation_space.shape, env.action_space.n)

# Train the agent
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state

# Evaluate the trained agent
state = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
    env.render()
    action = agent.choose_action(state)
    state, _, done, _ = env.step(action)
```

    optimizer.step()
```

Slide 10: Topological Generative Models

Topological Generative Models are a class of generative models that incorporate topological information into their architecture. They can be used to generate new data samples that preserve the topological structure of the original data distribution, which can be useful for tasks such as data augmentation, anomaly detection, and generative modeling.

Code:

```

Slide 11: Topological Regularization Techniques

Topological Regularization Techniques are methods used to incorporate topological information into the training process of neural network models, helping to improve their generalization performance and robustness. These techniques can take various forms, such as topological data augmentation, topological loss functions, or topological constraints on the model's parameters.

Code:

```

Slide 12: Topological Adversarial Training

Topological Adversarial Training is a technique used to improve the robustness of neural network models against adversarial attacks by incorporating topological information into the training process. It involves generating adversarial examples that preserve the topological structure of the input data and training the model to be robust against these topologically-constrained adversarial examples.

Slide 7 Topological Graph Neural Networks

Topological Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are a class of neural network models designed to operate on graph-structured data while incorporating topological information. They can learn representations that capture the topological properties of the graph, which can be useful for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph generation.

Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from topological_gnn import TopologicalGCN

# Load and preprocess graph data
graph_data = load_graph_data()

# Create a Topological Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) model
model = TopologicalGCN(input_dim=graph_data.node_features.shape[1], hidden_dim=64, output_dim=graph_data.num_classes)

# Define the loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Train the model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(graph_data.node_features, graph_data.edge_index)
    loss = criterion(outputs[graph_data.train_mask], graph_data.node_labels[graph_data.train_mask])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# Evaluate the model
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(graph_data.node_features, graph_data.edge_index)
    accuracy = (outputs[graph_data.test_mask].argmax(dim=1) == graph_data.node_labels[graph_data.test_mask]).float().mean()
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy.item()}")
```

In this rewritten slide, we include a complete example of training and evaluating a Topological Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) model on a graph dataset. The code assumes that the `load_graph_data` function returns a dictionary containing the node features, edge indices, node labels, and train/test masks for the graph data.

We first create a TGCN model with specified input, hidden, and output dimensions. Then, we define a cross-entropy loss function and use an Adam optimizer to train the model on the graph data. During training, we perform forward passes on the node features and edge indices, compute the loss on the training nodes, and update the model parameters accordingly.

After training, we evaluate the model on the test nodes by computing the accuracy of the predicted node labels. The output of the model is obtained by passing the node features and edge indices through the trained TGCN model.

This example demonstrates how to incorporate topological information from the graph structure into a neural network model and train it for tasks like node classification or link prediction.

Slide 8: Topological Attention Mechanisms

Topological Attention Mechanisms are a way to incorporate topological information into attention-based neural network models, such as Transformers. These mechanisms leverage topological concepts to determine the importance or relevance of different input elements based on their topological relationships, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant information.

Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from topological_attention import TopologicalAttention

# Load and preprocess data with topological information
data, topology = load_data_with_topology()

# Create a Transformer model with Topological Attention
model = nn.Transformer(d_model=512, nhead=8, num_encoder_layers=6, num_decoder_layers=6, dim_feedforward=2048, dropout=0.1)
model.encoder.layers[0].self_attn = TopologicalAttention(topology, d_model=512)

# Define the loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Train the model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# Evaluate the model
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(data)
    accuracy = (outputs.argmax(dim=1) == targets).float().mean()
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy.item()}")
```

We first create a Transformer model and replace the self-attention layer in the first encoder layer with a TopologicalAttention layer, which takes the topological information as input. We then define a cross-entropy loss function and use an Adam optimizer to train the model on the data.

During training, we perform forward passes through the model, compute the loss against the target labels, and update the model parameters accordingly. After training, we evaluate the model by computing the accuracy of the predicted outputs on the data.

This example demonstrates how to incorporate topological information into an attention-based model like the Transformer, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant input elements based on their topological relationships.

Slide 9: Topological Convolutional Neural Networks

Topological Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs) are a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that incorporate topological information into the convolution operation. They can be particularly useful for tasks involving data with non-Euclidean structures, such as meshes, point clouds, or manifolds.

Code:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from topological_cnn import TopologicalConv2d

# Load and preprocess data with topological information
data, topology = load_data_with_topology()

# Create a Topological CNN model
model = nn.Sequential(
    TopologicalConv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, topology=topology),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    TopologicalConv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3, topology=topology),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(64 * 4 * 4, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
)

# Define the loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Train the model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# Evaluate the model
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(data)
    accuracy = (outputs.argmax(dim=1) == targets).float().mean()
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy.item()}")
```

In this slide, we provide an example of a Topological Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) for image classification tasks. The code assumes that the `load_data_with_topology` function returns the input data (e.g., images) and its corresponding topological information.

We define a TCNN model using the `TopologicalConv2d` layer, which performs 2D convolutions while incorporating the topological information. The model consists of two TopologicalConv2d layers, followed by ReLU activations and max-pooling layers, and then fully connected layers for classification.

We use a cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer to train the model on the data. During training, we perform forward passes through the model, compute the loss against the target labels, and update the model parameters accordingly. After training, we evaluate the model by computing the accuracy of the predicted outputs on the data.

This example demonstrates how to incorporate topological information into a CNN architecture, enabling the model to capture and process the topological structure of the input data, which can be beneficial for tasks involving non-Euclidean data representations.
