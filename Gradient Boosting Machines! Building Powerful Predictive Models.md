## Gradient Boosting Machines! Building Powerful Predictive Models
Slide 1: Introduction to Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Gradient Boosting Machines are powerful ensemble learning techniques that sequentially combine weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. This iterative approach builds upon the errors of previous models, allowing for continuous improvement in predictive accuracy.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a sample regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, noise=0.1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train a GBM model
gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)

print(f"R-squared score: {gbm.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 2: Key Components of GBM

GBM consists of several key components that work together to create a robust predictive model. These include the loss function, weak learners, additive model, and gradient descent optimization. The loss function measures the model's performance, while weak learners (typically shallow decision trees) are used to incrementally refine the model.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Create a weak learner (decision tree stump)
weak_learner = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=1)

# Create a GBM with custom weak learner
custom_gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    base_estimator=weak_learner
)

custom_gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Custom GBM R-squared score: {custom_gbm.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 3: Loss Functions in GBM

The loss function is crucial in GBM as it guides the model's learning process. Different loss functions are used for various types of problems, such as mean squared error for regression and log loss for classification. The choice of loss function affects how the model optimizes its predictions.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit

def mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean((y_true - y_pred) ** 2)

def log_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(expit(y_pred)) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - expit(y_pred)))

# Example usage
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([-1.2, 0.8, 1.5, -0.5, 1.1])

print(f"MSE Loss: {mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):.4f}")
print(f"Log Loss: {log_loss(y_true, y_pred):.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Weak Learners in GBM

Weak learners in GBM are typically shallow decision trees, often referred to as "stumps". These simple models are combined to create a powerful ensemble. The use of weak learners helps prevent overfitting and allows the model to capture complex patterns in the data.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a decision tree stump
stump = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=1)

# Fit the stump to the data
stump.fit(X_train[:, [0]], y_train)

# Visualize the decision stump
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X_train[:, 0], y_train, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot(sorted(X_train[:, 0]), stump.predict(sorted(X_train[:, 0]).reshape(-1, 1)), color='r')
plt.title("Decision Tree Stump (Weak Learner)")
plt.xlabel("Feature 0")
plt.ylabel("Target")
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Additive Model in GBM

GBM builds an additive model by sequentially adding weak learners. Each new learner focuses on the residuals of the previous model, aiming to correct the errors. This step-by-step approach allows the model to gradually improve its predictions.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

class SimpleGBM:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.n_estimators = n_estimators
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.models = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.models = []
        residuals = y.()
        for _ in range(self.n_estimators):
            model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=1)
            model.fit(X, residuals)
            self.models.append(model)
            predictions = model.predict(X)
            residuals -= self.learning_rate * predictions

    def predict(self, X):
        return sum(self.learning_rate * model.predict(X) for model in self.models)

# Usage
simple_gbm = SimpleGBM(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
simple_gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = simple_gbm.predict(X_test)
print(f"Simple GBM MSE: {np.mean((y_test - y_pred) ** 2):.4f}")
```

Slide 6: Gradient Descent Optimization

GBM uses gradient descent optimization to minimize the loss function. Each new tree approximates the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current predictions. This process guides the model towards better performance with each iteration.

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000):
    m, n = X.shape
    theta = np.zeros(n)
    
    for _ in range(n_iterations):
        h = np.dot(X, theta)
        gradient = np.dot(X.T, (h - y)) / m
        theta -= learning_rate * gradient
    
    return theta

# Generate sample data
X = np.column_stack((np.ones(100), np.random.rand(100, 1)))
y = 2 + 3 * X[:, 1] + np.random.randn(100) * 0.1

# Perform gradient descent
theta = gradient_descent(X, y)
print("Estimated coefficients:", theta)
```

Slide 7: How Residuals Work in GBM

Residuals play a crucial role in GBM. The process starts with an initial prediction, often the mean of the target variable. GBM then calculates residuals between actual and predicted values. Each subsequent tree is trained on these residuals, focusing on areas where the model performed poorly.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, X.shape[0])

# Initial prediction (mean of y)
initial_pred = np.full_like(y, y.mean())

# Calculate residuals
residuals = y - initial_pred

# Fit a tree to the residuals
tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
tree.fit(X, residuals)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.scatter(X, y, label='Actual data')
plt.plot(X, initial_pred, label='Initial prediction', color='r')
plt.plot(X, initial_pred + tree.predict(X), label='Updated prediction', color='g')
plt.legend()
plt.title('GBM: Fitting to Residuals')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Iterative Process in GBM

GBM follows an iterative process of computing residuals, fitting a new tree, and updating the model. This cycle continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching the maximum number of trees or achieving minimal improvement in performance.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

class IterativeGBM:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.n_estimators = n_estimators
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.models = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.models = []
        current_predictions = np.zeros_like(y)
        for _ in range(self.n_estimators):
            residuals = y - current_predictions
            model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
            model.fit(X, residuals)
            self.models.append(model)
            current_predictions += self.learning_rate * model.predict(X)
            mse = mean_squared_error(y, current_predictions)
            print(f"Iteration {len(self.models)}, MSE: {mse:.4f}")

    def predict(self, X):
        return sum(self.learning_rate * model.predict(X) for model in self.models)

# Usage
iterative_gbm = IterativeGBM(n_estimators=10, learning_rate=0.1)
iterative_gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 9: Tuning Hyperparameters: Learning Rate

The learning rate controls the contribution of each tree to the final prediction. Smaller rates typically lead to better performance but require more trees. Tuning this parameter is crucial for achieving optimal model performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.5],
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200]
}

# Create GBM model
gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor()

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(gbm, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print best parameters and score
print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best MSE:", -grid_search.best_score_)
```

Slide 10: Tuning Hyperparameters: Number of Trees

The number of trees in a GBM model significantly impacts its performance. Too few trees can lead to underfitting, while too many can cause overfitting. Finding the right balance is key to creating an effective model.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

n_estimators_range = range(1, 201, 10)
train_scores = []
test_scores = []

for n_estimators in n_estimators_range:
    gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=n_estimators, learning_rate=0.1)
    gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_pred = gbm.predict(X_train)
    test_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)
    train_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_pred))
    test_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_test, test_pred))

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(n_estimators_range, train_scores, label='Train MSE')
plt.plot(n_estimators_range, test_scores, label='Test MSE')
plt.xlabel('Number of Trees')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Effect of Number of Trees on GBM Performance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Tuning Hyperparameters: Tree Depth

Tree depth controls the complexity of individual trees in the GBM model. Shallow trees can help reduce overfitting but may miss complex patterns, while deeper trees can capture more intricate relationships but risk overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

max_depths = range(1, 11)
cv_scores = []

for depth in max_depths:
    gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=depth, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
    scores = cross_val_score(gbm, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
    cv_scores.append(-scores.mean())

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(max_depths, cv_scores)
plt.xlabel('Max Depth')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.title('Effect of Tree Depth on GBM Performance')
plt.show()

best_depth = max_depths[np.argmin(cv_scores)]
print(f"Best max_depth: {best_depth}")
```

Slide 12: Feature Importance in GBM

One of the advantages of GBM is its ability to provide insights into feature importance. This helps in understanding which features are driving the predictions and can be valuable for feature selection and model interpretation.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train GBM model
gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get feature importances
importances = gbm.feature_importances_
feature_names = [f"Feature {i}" for i in range(X_train.shape[1])]

# Sort features by importance
sorted_idx = importances.argsort()
sorted_features = [feature_names[i] for i in sorted_idx]

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(range(len(importances)), importances[sorted_idx])
plt.yticks(range(len(importances)), sorted_features)
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importances in GBM Model')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Predicting House Prices

GBM can be applied to various real-world problems, such as predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and age. This example demonstrates how to use GBM for a regression task using the Boston Housing dataset.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Boston Housing dataset
boston = load_boston()
X, y = boston.data, boston.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train GBM model
gbm = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2:.2f}")

# Plot predicted vs actual values
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], 'r--', lw=2)
plt.xlabel("Actual Price")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Price")
plt.title("GBM: Predicted vs Actual House Prices")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Classifying Iris Flowers

GBM is also effective for classification tasks. In this example, we'll use GBM to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. This demonstrates how GBM can be applied to multi-class classification problems.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train GBM classifier
gbm = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=iris.target_names))

# Plot feature importances
feature_importance = gbm.feature_importances_
sorted_idx = feature_importance.argsort()
pos = plt.barh(range(len(feature_importance)), feature_importance[sorted_idx])
plt.yticks(range(len(feature_importance)), [iris.feature_names[i] for i in sorted_idx])
plt.title("Feature Importances for Iris Classification")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
