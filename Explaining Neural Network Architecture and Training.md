## Explaining Neural Network Architecture and Training

Slide 1: Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simple_neuron(inputs, weights, bias):
    return np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias

# Example
inputs = np.array([1, 2, 3])
weights = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
bias = 1

output = simple_neuron(inputs, weights, bias)
print(f"Neuron output: {output}")
```

Slide 2: Basic Architecture - Layers

Neural networks typically consist of three types of layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each layer contains neurons that process and transmit information.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN(input_size=3, hidden_size=5, output_size=2)
print(model)
```

Slide 3: Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, relu(x), label='ReLU')
plt.plot(x, sigmoid(x), label='Sigmoid')
plt.plot(x, tanh(x), label='Tanh')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Activation Functions')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the network to generate predictions. It involves matrix multiplication and activation function application at each layer.

```python
import numpy as np

def forward_propagation(X, weights, biases):
    layer1 = np.dot(X, weights[0]) + biases[0]
    activation1 = np.maximum(0, layer1)  # ReLU activation
    layer2 = np.dot(activation1, weights[1]) + biases[1]
    output = sigmoid(layer2)
    return output

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example usage
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])
weights = [np.random.randn(3, 4), np.random.randn(4, 1)]
biases = [np.random.randn(1, 4), np.random.randn(1, 1)]

prediction = forward_propagation(X, weights, biases)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

Slide 5: Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks. It calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters, allowing for weight updates.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(2, 3)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(3, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.linear1(x))
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(100):
    inputs = torch.randn(10, 2)
    targets = torch.randn(10, 1)
    
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Training complete")
```

Slide 6: Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the difference between predicted and actual outputs. They guide the network's learning process. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy.

```python
import numpy as np

def mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean((y_true - y_pred)**2)

def binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred):
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

# Example
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.95])

mse = mse_loss(y_true, y_pred)
bce = binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"MSE Loss: {mse}")
print(f"Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: {bce}")
```

Slide 7: Optimizers

Optimizers update the network's weights based on the calculated gradients. Popular optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()

# Different optimizers
sgd_optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
adam_optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
rmsprop_optimizer = optim.RMSprop(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

print("Optimizers initialized")
```

Slide 8: Batch Normalization

Batch Normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and accelerating training. It helps in training deeper networks and can act as a regularizer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class BatchNormModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BatchNormModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = BatchNormModel()
print(model)

# Example usage
input_data = torch.randn(32, 10)  # Batch of 32 samples
output = model(input_data)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 9: Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training, which helps prevent overfitting.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DropoutModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dropout_rate=0.5):
        super(DropoutModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(100, 50)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = DropoutModel()
print(model)

# Training mode (dropout active)
model.train()
train_input = torch.randn(10, 100)
train_output = model(train_input)

# Evaluation mode (dropout inactive)
model.eval()
eval_input = torch.randn(10, 100)
eval_output = model(eval_input)

print("Dropout applied during training, not during evaluation")
```

Slide 10: Learning Rate and Scheduling

The learning rate determines the step size during optimization. Learning rate scheduling adjusts the learning rate during training to improve convergence.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Learning rate scheduler
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=30, gamma=0.1)

# Simulated training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step()
    
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Learning Rate: {scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]}")
```

Slide 11: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to detect spatial features.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 10)  # Assuming 32x32 input image
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 8 * 8)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN()
print(model)

# Example usage
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)  # One 32x32 RGB image
output = model(input_image)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 12: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed to work with sequential data by maintaining an internal state. They are commonly used in natural language processing and time series analysis.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleRNN, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        _, hidden = self.rnn(x)
        output = self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))
        return output

model = SimpleRNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5)
print(model)

# Example usage
sequence = torch.randn(1, 5, 10)  # Batch size 1, sequence length 5, input size 10
output = model(sequence)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 13: Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models as a starting point for a new task. It's particularly useful when working with limited data or complex architectures.

```python
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze the parameters
for param in resnet.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Modify the last layer for a new task (e.g., 10 classes)
num_ftrs = resnet.fc.in_features
resnet.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)

# Now only the last layer is trainable
print("Trainable parameters:")
for name, param in resnet.named_parameters():
    if param.requires_grad:
        print(name)
```

Slide 14: Real-life Example: Image Classification

Image classification is a common application of neural networks. Here's a simple example using a pre-trained model for classifying everyday objects.

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision.models import resnet50
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
model = resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Prepare image
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load and preprocess image (replace with your image path)
img = Image.open("example_image.jpg")
img_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)

# Make prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(img_tensor)

# Get top prediction
_, predicted_idx = torch.max(output, 1)

# Load class labels (simplified version)
class_labels = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 
                'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

print(f"Predicted class: {class_labels[predicted_idx.item()]}")
```

Slide 15: Real-life Example: Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is another common application of neural networks, particularly in natural language processing. Here's a simple example using a pre-trained model for analyzing sentiment in text.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained sentiment analysis model
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Example texts
texts = [
    "I love this product! It's amazing!",
    "This movie was terrible and a waste of time.",
    "The weather is nice today, but I'm feeling neutral about it."
]

# Analyze sentiment
for text in texts:
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)[0]
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```
