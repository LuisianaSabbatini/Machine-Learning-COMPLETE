## File Handling in Python
Slide 1: Opening a File

Python's file handling capabilities allow you to interact with files on your system. To begin working with a file, you need to open it using the `open()` function. This function takes two main arguments: the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file. The mode determines whether you can read from or write to the file.

Slide 2: Source Code for Opening a File

```python
# Open a file in read mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Open a file in write mode (creates a new file or overwrites existing)
file_write = open("new_file.txt", "w")

# Open a file in append mode (adds to the end of the file)
file_append = open("log.txt", "a")

# Don't forget to close the files when you're done
file.close()
file_write.close()
file_append.close()
```

Slide 3: Reading from a File

Once you've opened a file in read mode, you can extract its contents using various methods. The most common methods are `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`. The `read()` method reads the entire file as a single string, `readline()` reads one line at a time, and `readlines()` returns a list of all lines in the file.

Slide 4: Source Code for Reading from a File

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read the entire file content
    content = file.read()
    print("Entire file content:")
    print(content)

    # Reset file pointer to the beginning
    file.seek(0)

    # Read file line by line
    print("\nReading line by line:")
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace
```

Slide 5: Writing to a File

Writing to a file allows you to store data persistently. To write to a file, you need to open it in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a'). The write mode creates a new file or overwrites an existing one, while the append mode adds content to the end of an existing file.

Slide 6: Source Code for Writing to a File

```python
# Writing to a new file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.\n")

# Appending to an existing file
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This line is appended.\n")

# Reading the file to verify the content
with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

Slide 7: Using the `with` Statement

The `with` statement provides a cleaner way to work with files. It automatically handles the closing of the file, even if an exception occurs during file operations. This approach is preferred over manually opening and closing files, as it reduces the risk of leaving files open unintentionally.

Slide 8: Source Code for Using the `with` Statement

```python
# Using 'with' statement for file handling
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# File is automatically closed after the 'with' block

# Trying to read from the closed file will raise an error
try:
    print(file.read())
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Slide 9: Working with CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used for storing tabular data. Python's built-in `csv` module provides functionality to read from and write to CSV files easily. This module handles the complexities of parsing and generating CSV data, making it simple to work with spreadsheet-like data.

Slide 10: Source Code for Working with CSV Files

```python
import csv

# Writing to a CSV file
data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['Alice', 30, 'New York'],
    ['Bob', 25, 'San Francisco'],
    ['Charlie', 35, 'London']
]

with open('people.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)

# Reading from a CSV file
with open('people.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(', '.join(row))
```

Slide 11: Real-life Example: Log File Analysis

In this example, we'll analyze a server log file to count the number of occurrences of different HTTP status codes. This task is common in web server administration and can help identify potential issues or unusual activity.

Slide 12: Source Code for Log File Analysis

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def analyze_log(filename):
    status_counts = defaultdict(int)

    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            parts = line.split()
            if len(parts) >= 9:
                status_code = parts[8]
                status_counts[status_code] += 1

    return status_counts

# Assume we have a log file named 'server.log'
results = analyze_log('server.log')

print("HTTP Status Code Counts:")
for status, count in results.items():
    print(f"Status {status}: {count} occurrences")
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Data Backup System

This example demonstrates a simple data backup system that copies important files to a backup directory. It uses file handling to read the source files and write them to the backup location, while also maintaining a log of the backup process.

Slide 14: Source Code for Data Backup System

```python
import os
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

def backup_files(source_dir, backup_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
        os.makedirs(backup_dir)

    log_file = os.path.join(backup_dir, "backup_log.txt")

    with open(log_file, "a") as log:
        log.write(f"Backup started at {datetime.now()}\n")

        for root, _, files in os.walk(source_dir):
            for file in files:
                src_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                rel_path = os.path.relpath(src_path, source_dir)
                dest_path = os.path.join(backup_dir, rel_path)

                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(dest_path), exist_ok=True)
                shutil.copy2(src_path, dest_path)
                log.write(f"Backed up: {rel_path}\n")

        log.write(f"Backup completed at {datetime.now()}\n\n")

# Usage example
backup_files("/path/to/important/files", "/path/to/backup/directory")
```
