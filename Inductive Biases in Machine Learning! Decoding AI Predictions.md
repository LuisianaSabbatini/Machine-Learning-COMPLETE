## Inductive Biases in Machine Learning! Decoding AI Predictions
Slide 1: Inductive Biases in Machine Learning

Inductive biases are fundamental assumptions that machine learning models use to generalize from training data to unseen examples. These biases shape how models learn and make predictions, acting as a guide for the learning process. Understanding inductive biases is crucial for selecting appropriate models and interpreting their behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some sample data
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(X, y, alpha=0.5)
plt.title("Linear Regression: An Example of Inductive Bias")
plt.xlabel("X")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.show()

# The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship,
# which is an example of an inductive bias
```

Slide 2: Linear Models: Simplicity and Linearity

Linear models embody two key inductive biases: linearity and simplicity. They assume a linear relationship between features and the target variable, and prefer simpler explanations over complex ones. This bias towards simplicity is often implemented through regularization techniques.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Create polynomial features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X.reshape(-1, 1))

# Fit linear and regularized models
linear_model = LinearRegression().fit(X.reshape(-1, 1), y)
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0).fit(X_poly, y)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(X, y, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot(X, linear_model.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)), label='Linear')
plt.plot(X, ridge_model.predict(X_poly), label='Ridge (Regularized)')
plt.legend()
plt.title("Linear vs Regularized Models")
plt.show()

# The Ridge model uses regularization to prefer simpler explanations
```

Slide 3: Decision Trees: Axis-Aligned Splits

Decision trees have an inductive bias towards axis-aligned decision boundaries. They recursively split the feature space along individual feature axes, creating rectangular decision regions. This bias makes them particularly effective for problems where the important distinctions in the data align with the feature axes.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.randn(200, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(int)

# Train a decision tree
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Plot decision boundary
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-3, 3, 100), np.linspace(-3, 3, 100))
Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]).reshape(xx.shape)

plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, alpha=0.8)
plt.title("Decision Tree: Axis-Aligned Splits")
plt.show()

# Note how the decision boundaries are always parallel to the axes
```

Slide 4: Support Vector Machines: Maximum Margin

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have an inductive bias towards finding the maximum margin between classes. This bias leads to better generalization, especially in high-dimensional spaces. SVMs also assume that the decision boundary should be as smooth as possible.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Train an SVM
svm = SVC(kernel='linear')
svm.fit(X, y)

# Plot decision boundary
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-3, 3, 100), np.linspace(-3, 3, 100))
Z = svm.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]).reshape(xx.shape)

plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, alpha=0.8)
plt.scatter(svm.support_vectors_[:, 0], svm.support_vectors_[:, 1], s=100,
            linewidth=1, facecolors='none', edgecolors='k')
plt.title("SVM: Maximum Margin Classification")
plt.show()

# Notice how the decision boundary maximizes the margin between classes
```

Slide 5: Neural Networks: Hierarchical Representations

Neural networks have an inductive bias towards learning hierarchical representations. Each layer in a neural network can be thought of as learning increasingly abstract features of the input data. This bias makes neural networks particularly effective for complex tasks like image recognition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define a simple CNN for MNIST digit recognition
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()

# Each layer learns more abstract features:
# Early layers: edges, textures
# Middle layers: parts of digits
# Later layers: whole digits
```

Slide 6: Convolutional Neural Networks: Spatial Invariance

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have an inductive bias towards spatial invariance. This means they assume that the importance of a feature in an image doesn't depend on its exact location. This bias is implemented through the use of convolutional layers and pooling operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple convolutional layer
conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')

# Create a random input image
input_image = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))

# Apply the convolutional layer
output = conv_layer(input_image)

print(f"Input shape: {input_image.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

# The same convolutional filter is applied across the entire image,
# regardless of position, implementing the spatial invariance bias
```

Slide 7: Autoencoders: Dimensionality Reduction

Autoencoders have an inductive bias towards dimensionality reduction. They assume that the important information in the input data can be effectively represented in a lower-dimensional space. This bias makes autoencoders useful for tasks like data compression and feature learning.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define a simple autoencoder for MNIST digits
input_dim = 784  # 28x28 pixels

encoder = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
])

decoder = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(32,)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid'),
])

autoencoder = models.Sequential([encoder, decoder])

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# The encoder compresses the input to a 32-dimensional representation,
# assuming this is sufficient to capture the important features of the data
```

Slide 8: Transformers: Self-Attention and Positional Encoding

Transformers have inductive biases towards self-attention and positional awareness. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. Positional encoding ensures the model can distinguish between different positions in the sequence.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class PositionalEncoding(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, position, d_model):
        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()
        self.pos_encoding = self.positional_encoding(position, d_model)
    
    def get_angles(self, position, i, d_model):
        angles = 1 / tf.pow(10000, (2 * (i // 2)) / tf.cast(d_model, tf.float32))
        return position * angles
    
    def positional_encoding(self, position, d_model):
        angle_rads = self.get_angles(
            position=tf.range(position, dtype=tf.float32)[:, tf.newaxis],
            i=tf.range(d_model, dtype=tf.float32)[tf.newaxis, :],
            d_model=d_model)
        
        sines = tf.math.sin(angle_rads[:, 0::2])
        cosines = tf.math.cos(angle_rads[:, 1::2])
        
        pos_encoding = tf.concat([sines, cosines], axis=-1)
        pos_encoding = pos_encoding[tf.newaxis, ...]
        
        return tf.cast(pos_encoding, tf.float32)
    
    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs + self.pos_encoding[:, :tf.shape(inputs)[1], :]

# Example usage
seq_length = 50
d_model = 512
pos_encoding = PositionalEncoding(seq_length, d_model)

# The positional encoding allows the model to distinguish between
# different positions in the input sequence
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Image classification is a common application that leverages several inductive biases. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for this task due to their biases towards spatial invariance and hierarchical feature learning.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

# Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Define the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, 
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

# The CNN's inductive biases allow it to effectively learn
# features for image classification
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks often benefit from the inductive biases of transformer models. The self-attention mechanism allows these models to capture complex relationships between words in a sentence.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load a dataset
examples, metadata = tfds.load('ted_hrlr_translate/pt_to_en', with_info=True,
                               as_supervised=True)
train_examples, val_examples = examples['train'], examples['validation']

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer_en = tfds.features.text.SubwordTextEncoder.build_from_corpus(
    (en.numpy() for pt, en in train_examples), target_vocab_size=2**13)

# Example sentence
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
tokenized_sentence = tokenizer_en.encode(sentence)

print(f"Original sentence: {sentence}")
print(f"Tokenized sentence: {tokenized_sentence}")
print(f"Decoded sentence: {tokenizer_en.decode(tokenized_sentence)}")

# Transformer models use self-attention to capture relationships
# between words, regardless of their distance in the sentence
```

Slide 11: Balancing Inductive Biases and Data

While inductive biases are crucial for learning, it's important to balance them with the amount and quality of available data. With limited data, stronger inductive biases can help prevent overfitting. As data increases, models with weaker biases may perform better.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve

def generate_data(n_samples, noise=0.1):
    X = np.linspace(0, 10, n_samples).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.normal(0, noise, n_samples)
    return X, y

# Generate learning curves for linear regression and neural network
def plot_learning_curve(estimator, X, y, title):
    train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(
        estimator, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, train_sizes=np.linspace(.1, 1.0, 5))
    
    plt.figure()
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel("Training examples")
    plt.ylabel("Score")
    plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(train_scores, axis=1), 'o-', label="Training score")
    plt.plot(train_sizes, np.mean(test_scores, axis=1), 'o-', label="Cross-validation score")
    plt.legend(loc="best")
    plt.show()

X, y = generate_data(1000)
plot_learning_curve(LinearRegression(), X, y, "Learning Curve (Linear Regression)")
plot_learning_curve(MLPRegressor(), X, y, "Learning Curve (Neural Network)")

# Notice how the linear model (stronger bias) performs better with less data,
# while the neural network (weaker bias) improves more with more data
```

Slide 12: Inductive Biases in Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, combine multiple models to make predictions. These methods have their own inductive biases, often related to how they aggregate individual model predictions and handle feature importance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, noise=0.1)

# Train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

rf.fit(X, y)
gb.fit(X, y)

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.bar(range(20), rf.feature_importances_)
plt.title("Random Forest Feature Importances")
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.bar(range(20), gb.feature_importances_)
plt.title("Gradient Boosting Feature Importances")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Ensemble methods have biases in how they determine feature importance
# and combine individual model predictions
```

Slide 13: Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms incorporate inductive biases related to how they explore environments, represent value functions, and model dynamics. Many RL algorithms assume the Markov property, which states that the future only depends on the current state, not the history of states.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

# Create a simple environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])

# Q-learning algorithm (simplified)
def q_learning(episodes, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.6, epsilon=0.1):
    for _ in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        
        while not done:
            if np.random.random() < epsilon:
                action = env.action_space.sample()  # Explore
            else:
                action = np.argmax(Q[state])  # Exploit
            
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            
            # Q-value update (assumes Markov property)
            Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])
            
            state = next_state

    return Q

# Train the agent
Q = q_learning(10000)

# The Q-learning algorithm assumes the Markov property in its value updates
```

Slide 14: Transfer Learning and Inductive Biases

Transfer learning leverages inductive biases learned from one task to improve performance on another. This approach assumes that certain features or patterns are shared across related tasks, allowing models to generalize more effectively with limited data on new tasks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load pre-trained VGG16 model
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add new layers for the target task
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes in the new task
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# The model leverages features learned from ImageNet,
# assuming they're relevant for the new task
```
