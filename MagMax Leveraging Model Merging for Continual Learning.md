## MagMax Leveraging Model Merging for Continual Learning
Slide 1: MagMax: An Introduction to Seamless Continual Learning

MagMax is a novel approach to continual learning that leverages model merging techniques. It aims to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by allowing models to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned information.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MagMaxModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MagMaxModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        return self.layer2(x)

# Create a simple MagMax model
model = MagMaxModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=2)
print(model)
```

Slide 2: The Problem: Catastrophic Forgetting

Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a neural network, trained on a new task, rapidly loses its ability to perform well on previously learned tasks. This is a significant challenge in continual learning scenarios.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate catastrophic forgetting
def simulate_forgetting(num_tasks, forgetting_rate):
    performance = np.ones(num_tasks)
    for i in range(1, num_tasks):
        performance[:i] *= (1 - forgetting_rate)
    return performance

tasks = range(1, 11)
forgetting = simulate_forgetting(10, 0.2)

plt.plot(tasks, forgetting)
plt.xlabel('Number of Tasks Learned')
plt.ylabel('Performance on Previous Tasks')
plt.title('Catastrophic Forgetting Simulation')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: MagMax: Core Concept

MagMax addresses catastrophic forgetting by merging models trained on different tasks. It maintains a pool of task-specific models and combines them to create a unified model that can perform well on multiple tasks.

```python
class MagMaxPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {}
    
    def add_model(self, task_id, model):
        self.models[task_id] = model
    
    def merge_models(self, task_ids):
        merged_model = MagMaxModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=2)
        for task_id in task_ids:
            for param, merged_param in zip(self.models[task_id].parameters(), merged_model.parameters()):
                merged_param.data += param.data
        for param in merged_model.parameters():
            param.data /= len(task_ids)
        return merged_model

# Usage example
pool = MagMaxPool()
pool.add_model(1, MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2))
pool.add_model(2, MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2))
merged = pool.merge_models([1, 2])
```

Slide 4: Model Merging Techniques

MagMax employs various model merging techniques to combine task-specific models effectively. These techniques include weight averaging, layer-wise merging, and attention-based merging.

```python
def weight_averaging(models):
    avg_model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
    for param in avg_model.parameters():
        param.data.zero_()
    
    for model in models:
        for avg_param, model_param in zip(avg_model.parameters(), model.parameters()):
            avg_param.data += model_param.data
    
    for param in avg_model.parameters():
        param.data /= len(models)
    
    return avg_model

# Example usage
model1 = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
model2 = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
merged_model = weight_averaging([model1, model2])
```

Slide 5: Task-Specific Adaptation

MagMax allows for task-specific adaptation by fine-tuning the merged model on individual tasks. This process helps to maintain performance on previously learned tasks while adapting to new ones.

```python
def adapt_to_task(merged_model, task_data, num_epochs=5):
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(merged_model.parameters())
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for inputs, targets in task_data:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = merged_model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    
    return merged_model

# Simulated task data
task_data = [(torch.randn(10, 10), torch.randn(10, 2)) for _ in range(100)]
adapted_model = adapt_to_task(merged_model, task_data)
```

Slide 6: Continual Learning Pipeline

The MagMax continual learning pipeline involves training task-specific models, merging them, and adapting the merged model to new tasks. This process is repeated as new tasks are encountered.

```python
class MagMaxPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pool = MagMaxPool()
        self.current_model = None
    
    def train_new_task(self, task_id, task_data):
        new_model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
        new_model = adapt_to_task(new_model, task_data)
        self.pool.add_model(task_id, new_model)
        
        if self.current_model is None:
            self.current_model = new_model
        else:
            self.current_model = self.pool.merge_models(self.pool.models.keys())
            self.current_model = adapt_to_task(self.current_model, task_data)

# Usage example
pipeline = MagMaxPipeline()
for task_id in range(1, 6):
    task_data = [(torch.randn(10, 10), torch.randn(10, 2)) for _ in range(100)]
    pipeline.train_new_task(task_id, task_data)
```

Slide 7: Handling Heterogeneous Tasks

MagMax can handle heterogeneous tasks by employing task-specific heads or adapters. This allows the model to maintain a shared representation while having specialized components for different tasks.

```python
class MagMaxMultiTaskModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_tasks):
        super(MagMaxMultiTaskModel, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.task_heads = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(hidden_size, 2) for _ in range(num_tasks)])
    
    def forward(self, x, task_id):
        x = torch.relu(self.shared_layer(x))
        return self.task_heads[task_id](x)

# Create a multi-task MagMax model
multi_task_model = MagMaxMultiTaskModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_tasks=3)
print(multi_task_model)
```

Slide 8: Efficient Knowledge Transfer

MagMax facilitates efficient knowledge transfer between tasks by leveraging the shared knowledge in the merged model. This allows for faster learning on new tasks and improved generalization.

```python
def knowledge_transfer(source_model, target_model, alpha=0.5):
    for source_param, target_param in zip(source_model.parameters(), target_model.parameters()):
        target_param.data = alpha * source_param.data + (1 - alpha) * target_param.data
    return target_model

# Example usage
source_model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
target_model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
transferred_model = knowledge_transfer(source_model, target_model)
```

Slide 9: Selective Model Merging

MagMax can perform selective model merging by identifying and combining only the most relevant components from different task-specific models. This helps in creating more efficient and effective merged models.

```python
def selective_merge(models, similarity_threshold=0.8):
    merged_model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)
    for param_name, param in merged_model.named_parameters():
        param_list = [model.state_dict()[param_name] for model in models]
        similarities = torch.tensor([torch.cosine_similarity(param, p, dim=0) for p in param_list])
        mask = similarities > similarity_threshold
        if mask.any():
            param.data = torch.stack([p for p, m in zip(param_list, mask) if m]).mean(dim=0)
        else:
            param.data = torch.stack(param_list).mean(dim=0)
    return merged_model

# Example usage
models = [MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2) for _ in range(3)]
selectively_merged_model = selective_merge(models)
```

Slide 10: Handling Catastrophic Forgetting

MagMax mitigates catastrophic forgetting by preserving important knowledge from previous tasks through model merging and selective adaptation. This allows the model to maintain performance on old tasks while learning new ones.

```python
def evaluate_forgetting(model, tasks):
    performances = []
    for task in tasks:
        # Simulate task evaluation
        performance = torch.rand(1).item()  # Replace with actual evaluation
        performances.append(performance)
    return performances

# Simulate learning multiple tasks
tasks = [f"Task_{i}" for i in range(5)]
model = MagMaxModel(10, 20, 2)

for task in tasks:
    # Train on new task
    adapt_to_task(model, [(torch.randn(10, 10), torch.randn(10, 2)) for _ in range(100)])
    
    # Evaluate performance on all tasks
    performances = evaluate_forgetting(model, tasks)
    plt.plot(range(len(tasks)), performances, marker='o')

plt.xlabel('Tasks')
plt.ylabel('Performance')
plt.title('Performance Across Tasks (Higher is Better)')
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

In this example, we'll use MagMax for continual learning in image classification tasks. We'll train the model on different subsets of the CIFAR-10 dataset, simulating the addition of new classes over time.

```python
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])
cifar10 = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)

# Create task-specific datasets
task1 = torch.utils.data.Subset(cifar10, torch.where(torch.tensor(cifar10.targets) < 2)[0])
task2 = torch.utils.data.Subset(cifar10, torch.where((torch.tensor(cifar10.targets) >= 2) & (torch.tensor(cifar10.targets) < 4))[0])

# Train MagMax on tasks
magmax = MagMaxPipeline()
magmax.train_new_task(1, torch.utils.data.DataLoader(task1, batch_size=32, shuffle=True))
magmax.train_new_task(2, torch.utils.data.DataLoader(task2, batch_size=32, shuffle=True))

# Evaluate on both tasks
accuracy1 = evaluate_model(magmax.current_model, task1)
accuracy2 = evaluate_model(magmax.current_model, task2)
print(f"Accuracy on Task 1: {accuracy1:.2f}%, Task 2: {accuracy2:.2f}%")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Natural Language Processing

In this example, we'll apply MagMax to continual learning in natural language processing tasks. We'll train the model on sentiment analysis for different domains, such as movie reviews and product reviews.

```python
from torchtext.datasets import IMDB, AmazonReviewFull
from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer
from torchtext.vocab import build_vocab_from_iterator

# Load datasets
imdb_train = IMDB(split='train')
amazon_train = AmazonReviewFull(split='train')

tokenizer = get_tokenizer('basic_english')
vocab = build_vocab_from_iterator(map(tokenizer, imdb_train), specials=['<unk>'])
vocab.set_default_index(vocab['<unk>'])

def text_pipeline(x):
    return vocab(tokenizer(x))

# Create MagMax models for each task
imdb_model = MagMaxModel(len(vocab), 64, 2)
amazon_model = MagMaxModel(len(vocab), 64, 2)

# Train models on respective tasks
train_model(imdb_model, imdb_train)
train_model(amazon_model, amazon_train)

# Merge models using MagMax
merged_model = weight_averaging([imdb_model, amazon_model])

# Evaluate merged model on both tasks
imdb_accuracy = evaluate_model(merged_model, IMDB(split='test'))
amazon_accuracy = evaluate_model(merged_model, AmazonReviewFull(split='test'))
print(f"Accuracy on IMDB: {imdb_accuracy:.2f}%, Amazon: {amazon_accuracy:.2f}%")
```

Slide 13: Challenges and Future Directions

While MagMax shows promise in addressing catastrophic forgetting, there are still challenges to overcome:

1. Scalability to large-scale problems and models
2. Handling tasks with significantly different distributions
3. Optimizing the model merging process for efficiency
4. Developing better metrics for measuring continual learning performance

Slide 14: Challenges and Future Directions

Future research directions include:

Slide 15: Challenges and Future Directions

```python
def future_magmax_pipeline():
    # Placeholder for future MagMax improvements
    class ImprovedMagMax:
        def __init__(self):
            self.base_model = create_dynamic_architecture()
            self.meta_learner = MetaLearner()
            self.task_adapters = {}
        
        def learn_new_task(self, task_data):
            task_adapter = self.meta_learner.generate_adapter(task_data)
            self.task_adapters[len(self.task_adapters)] = task_adapter
            self.update_base_model()
        
        def update_base_model(self):
            # Implement advanced model merging and knowledge distillation
            pass

    return ImprovedMagMax()

# This is a conceptual representation of future improvements
future_magmax = future_magmax_pipeline()
```
