Slide 1: Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a powerful machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the input space into smaller regions based on the feature values, creating a tree-like structure of decisions.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a decision tree classifier
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 2: Introduction to Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging or majority voting.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a random dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a random forest classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 3: Introduction to Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that iteratively trains weak models (e.g., decision trees) on the residuals of the previous models. It combines these weak models to create a strong predictive model, with each iteration aiming to correct the errors of the previous iteration.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_hastie_10_2
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a synthetic dataset
X, y = make_hastie_10_2(random_state=42)

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a gradient boosting classifier
gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=42)

# Train the classifier
gb.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Slide 4: Evaluating Model Performance

Once you've trained your models, it's essential to evaluate their performance on a separate test set. This allows you to assess how well the models generalize to unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Evaluate decision tree
y_pred_dt = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy_dt = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt)
precision_dt = precision_score(y_test, y_pred_dt, average='weighted')
recall_dt = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_dt, average='weighted')
f1_dt = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_dt, average='weighted')

# Evaluate random forest
y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)
accuracy_rf = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)
precision_rf = precision_score(y_test, y_pred_rf, average='weighted')
recall_rf = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_rf, average='weighted')
f1_rf = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_rf, average='weighted')

# Evaluate gradient boosting
y_pred_gb = gb.predict(X_test)
accuracy_gb = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_gb)
precision_gb = precision_score(y_test, y_pred_gb, average='weighted')
recall_gb = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_gb, average='weighted')
f1_gb = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_gb, average='weighted')
```

Slide 5: Visualizing Decision Trees

Decision trees can be visualized using various libraries, such as `graphviz`. This can help in understanding the structure of the tree and the decisions made at each node, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn import tree
import graphviz

# Visualize the decision tree
dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(clf, out_file=None, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names, filled=True, rounded=True, special_characters=True)
graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
graph.render("iris_tree")
```

Slide 6: Feature Importance in Random Forests

Random Forests provide a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for understanding the relative contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. This information can be used for feature selection or interpreting the model's behavior.

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd

# Get feature importance
importances = rf.feature_importances_

# Create a feature importance DataFrame
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': X.columns, 'importance': importances})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# Print the feature importance
print(feature_importance)
```

Slide 7: Hyperparameter Tuning for Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting models have several hyperparameters that can significantly impact their performance. Techniques like Grid Search or Random Search can be used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given dataset.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.05, 0.01],
    'max_depth': [4, 6, 8]
}

# Create a grid search object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=GradientBoostingClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)

# Fit the grid search object
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best parameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
```
