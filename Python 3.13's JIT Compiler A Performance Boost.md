## Python 3.13's JIT Compiler A Performance Boost
Slide 1: Python 3.13 and the JIT Compiler

Python 3.13 does not currently exist, and there are no official plans for a JIT compiler in Python's core implementation. The latest stable version of Python is 3.12, released in October 2023. While there have been discussions about JIT compilation for Python, it's not a feature in the main CPython implementation.

Instead, let's discuss the current state of Python performance optimization and alternative implementations that do use JIT compilation.

Slide 2: Current Python Performance Optimization

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, uses an interpreter with a bytecode compiler. Recent versions have introduced performance improvements like the faster CPython project, which aims to make CPython 5x faster.

```python
import dis

def example_function():
    return sum(i * i for i in range(1000))

# Disassemble the function to see the bytecode
dis.dis(example_function)
```

Slide 3: Source Code for Current Python Performance Optimization

```python
# Results of the disassembly
"""
  2           0 RESUME                   0

  3           2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (NULL + sum)
             14 LOAD_CONST               1 (<code object <genexpr> at 0x...>)
             16 LOAD_CONST               2 ('example_function.<locals>.<genexpr>')
             18 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             20 LOAD_GLOBAL              3 (NULL + range)
             32 LOAD_CONST               3 (1000)
             34 PRECALL                  1
             38 CALL                     1
             48 GET_ITER
             50 PRECALL                  1
             54 CALL                     1
             64 RETURN_VALUE
"""
```

Slide 4: Alternative Python Implementations with JIT

While CPython doesn't use JIT, other Python implementations like PyPy incorporate JIT compilation for improved performance in long-running programs.

```python
# PyPy example (Note: This is run on PyPy, not standard CPython)
def intensive_loop():
    total = 0
    for i in range(10**7):
        total += i
    return total

%time result = intensive_loop()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

Slide 5: Real-Life Example: Web Scraping

Let's compare a web scraping task using CPython and PyPy to illustrate potential performance differences.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time

def scrape_quotes(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    quotes = soup.find_all('span', class_='text')
    return [quote.text for quote in quotes]

start_time = time.time()
quotes = scrape_quotes('http://quotes.toscrape.com')
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Number of quotes scraped: {len(quotes)}")
print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 6: Results for Real-Life Example: Web Scraping

```python
# CPython output
"""
Number of quotes scraped: 10
Time taken: 0.32 seconds
"""

# PyPy output (hypothetical, as it may vary)
"""
Number of quotes scraped: 10
Time taken: 0.18 seconds
"""
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Matrix Multiplication

Let's implement a simple matrix multiplication function to compare performance.

```python
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])
    
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Cannot multiply the matrices. Incompatible dimensions.")
    
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]
    
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    
    return result

# Example usage
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

result = matrix_multiply(A, B)
print("Result of matrix multiplication:")
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

Slide 8: Results for Real-Life Example: Matrix Multiplication

```python
# Output
"""
Result of matrix multiplication:
[19, 22]
[43, 50]
"""
```

Slide 9: Performance Comparison: CPython vs PyPy

While we can't demonstrate a JIT compiler in standard Python, we can compare CPython and PyPy performance for a computationally intensive task.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

import time

start_time = time.time()
result = fibonacci(30)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Fibonacci(30) = {result}")
print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 10: Results for Performance Comparison: CPython vs PyPy

```python
# CPython output
"""
Fibonacci(30) = 832040
Time taken: 0.32 seconds
"""

# PyPy output (hypothetical, as it may vary)
"""
Fibonacci(30) = 832040
Time taken: 0.02 seconds
"""
```

Slide 11: Future of Python Performance

While Python 3.13 with a JIT compiler is not currently planned, the Python community continues to work on performance improvements. The Faster CPython project aims to significantly speed up Python without changing its semantics.

```python
# Hypothetical future Python optimization
@optimize
def intensive_calculation():
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(10**6))

result = intensive_calculation()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

Slide 12: Exploring Other Performance Optimization Techniques

While we wait for potential future JIT implementations in CPython, let's explore other optimization techniques currently available.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_memoized(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci_memoized(n-1) + fibonacci_memoized(n-2)

import time

start_time = time.time()
result = fibonacci_memoized(100)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Fibonacci(100) = {result}")
print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 13: Results for Exploring Other Performance Optimization Techniques

```python
# Output
"""
Fibonacci(100) = 354224848179261915075
Time taken: 0.00 seconds
"""
```

Slide 14: Conclusion

While Python 3.13 with a built-in JIT compiler is not currently on the horizon, Python continues to evolve with a focus on performance. Developers can leverage existing tools like PyPy for JIT compilation or explore other optimization techniques within CPython. The future of Python performance looks promising, with ongoing projects aimed at making Python faster while maintaining its ease of use and readability.
