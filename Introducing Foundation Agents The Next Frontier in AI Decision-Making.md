## Introducing Foundation Agents The Next Frontier in AI Decision-Making
Slide 1: What are Foundation Agents?

Foundation Agents are an emerging paradigm in AI that combines large language models (LLMs) with planning and decision-making capabilities. They aim to create more autonomous and capable AI systems that can reason, plan, and act in complex environments.

```python
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

class FoundationAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    def generate_response(self, prompt):
        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model.generate(**inputs)
        return self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

agent = FoundationAgent("gpt2")
response = agent.generate_response("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

Slide 2: Key Components of Foundation Agents

Foundation Agents typically consist of three main components: a large language model, a planning module, and an action selection mechanism. These components work together to process information, make decisions, and generate actions.

```python
class FoundationAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.llm = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.planner = PlanningModule()
        self.action_selector = ActionSelector()
    
    def process_input(self, input_data):
        llm_output = self.llm(input_data)
        plan = self.planner.create_plan(llm_output)
        action = self.action_selector.select_action(plan)
        return action

class PlanningModule:
    def create_plan(self, llm_output):
        # Implementation of planning algorithm
        pass

class ActionSelector:
    def select_action(self, plan):
        # Implementation of action selection
        pass
```

Slide 3: The Role of Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the foundation for these agents, providing a vast knowledge base and the ability to understand and generate human-like text. They enable the agent to process and interpret complex inputs.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

class LargeLanguageModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt2"):
        self.model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    def process_input(self, input_text):
        inputs = self.tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model.generate(inputs, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
        return self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

llm = LargeLanguageModel()
result = llm.process_input("Explain the concept of machine learning")
print(result)
```

Slide 4: Planning Module in Foundation Agents

The planning module allows the agent to formulate strategies and break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. It uses the output from the LLM to create a structured plan of action.

```python
import networkx as nx

class PlanningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_graph = nx.DiGraph()
    
    def create_plan(self, goal, current_state):
        # Simplified planning using a graph-based approach
        self.action_graph.add_node(current_state)
        self.action_graph.add_node(goal)
        
        # Add intermediate steps (simplified)
        intermediate_steps = ["research", "analyze", "implement", "test"]
        prev_step = current_state
        for step in intermediate_steps:
            self.action_graph.add_edge(prev_step, step)
            prev_step = step
        self.action_graph.add_edge(prev_step, goal)
        
        return list(nx.shortest_path(self.action_graph, current_state, goal))

planner = PlanningModule()
plan = planner.create_plan("complete project", "start")
print("Plan:", plan)
```

Slide 5: Action Selection Mechanism

The action selection mechanism is responsible for choosing the most appropriate action based on the current context and the plan generated by the planning module. It balances exploration and exploitation to make optimal decisions.

```python
import random

class ActionSelector:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=0.1):
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.action_values = {}
    
    def select_action(self, state, available_actions):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            # Exploration: choose a random action
            return random.choice(available_actions)
        else:
            # Exploitation: choose the action with the highest estimated value
            return max(available_actions, key=lambda a: self.action_values.get((state, a), 0))
    
    def update_action_value(self, state, action, reward):
        key = (state, action)
        if key not in self.action_values:
            self.action_values[key] = reward
        else:
            self.action_values[key] += 0.1 * (reward - self.action_values[key])

selector = ActionSelector()
state = "at_crossroads"
actions = ["go_left", "go_right", "go_straight"]
chosen_action = selector.select_action(state, actions)
print(f"Chosen action: {chosen_action}")

# Simulate receiving a reward and updating the action value
selector.update_action_value(state, chosen_action, reward=5)
```

Slide 6: Learning and Adaptation in Foundation Agents

Foundation Agents can learn and adapt over time by updating their knowledge base and decision-making strategies based on feedback and experience. This allows them to improve their performance on various tasks.

```python
import numpy as np

class AdaptiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.knowledge_base = {}
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        if state not in self.knowledge_base:
            self.knowledge_base[state] = {}
        if action not in self.knowledge_base[state]:
            self.knowledge_base[state][action] = 0
        
        # Q-learning update rule
        current_q = self.knowledge_base[state][action]
        max_next_q = max(self.knowledge_base.get(next_state, {}).values(), default=0)
        new_q = current_q + self.learning_rate * (reward + 0.9 * max_next_q - current_q)
        
        self.knowledge_base[state][action] = new_q
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if state in self.knowledge_base:
            return max(self.knowledge_base[state], key=self.knowledge_base[state].get)
        else:
            return np.random.choice(["up", "down", "left", "right"])

agent = AdaptiveAgent()
agent.learn("A", "right", 1, "B")
agent.learn("B", "down", 0, "C")
chosen_action = agent.choose_action("A")
print(f"Chosen action for state A: {chosen_action}")
```

Slide 7: Natural Language Understanding in Foundation Agents

Foundation Agents leverage advanced natural language understanding capabilities to interpret complex instructions and context. This allows them to operate in diverse domains and handle ambiguous or nuanced inputs.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

class NLUModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
    
    def understand_intent(self, text, possible_intents):
        result = self.classifier(text, possible_intents)
        return result["labels"][0], result["scores"][0]

nlu = NLUModule()
text = "What's the weather like today?"
intents = ["weather_inquiry", "greeting", "task_request"]
intent, confidence = nlu.understand_intent(text, intents)
print(f"Detected intent: {intent} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})")
```

Slide 8: Decision Making Under Uncertainty

Foundation Agents often need to make decisions in uncertain environments. They use probabilistic reasoning and decision theory to handle incomplete information and balance risk and reward.

```python
import numpy as np

class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.utility_function = lambda x: np.log(x + 1)  # Example utility function
    
    def expected_utility(self, action, outcomes, probabilities):
        utilities = [self.utility_function(outcome) for outcome in outcomes]
        return np.dot(utilities, probabilities)
    
    def make_decision(self, actions, outcomes, probabilities):
        best_action = max(actions, key=lambda a: self.expected_utility(a, outcomes[a], probabilities[a]))
        return best_action

dm = DecisionMaker()
actions = ["invest", "save"]
outcomes = {
    "invest": [100, 50, 0],
    "save": [60, 60, 60]
}
probabilities = {
    "invest": [0.3, 0.4, 0.3],
    "save": [1.0, 0, 0]
}

decision = dm.make_decision(actions, outcomes, probabilities)
print(f"Best decision: {decision}")
```

Slide 9: Multi-Agent Coordination

In complex scenarios, multiple Foundation Agents may need to work together. This slide explores techniques for coordination and collaboration among agents to solve larger-scale problems.

```python
import asyncio

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    async def perform_task(self, task):
        print(f"{self.name} is performing {task}")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate task execution
        return f"{task} completed by {self.name}"

class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
    
    def add_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)
    
    async def coordinate_tasks(self, tasks):
        results = await asyncio.gather(*(agent.perform_task(task) 
                                         for agent, task in zip(self.agents, tasks)))
        return results

# Usage
async def main():
    mas = MultiAgentSystem()
    mas.add_agent(Agent("Agent1"))
    mas.add_agent(Agent("Agent2"))
    
    tasks = ["Task A", "Task B"]
    results = await mas.coordinate_tasks(tasks)
    print("Results:", results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Slide 10: Ethical Considerations in Foundation Agents

As Foundation Agents become more capable, it's crucial to consider ethical implications. This slide discusses approaches to implementing ethical decision-making and safeguards in AI systems.

```python
class EthicalAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ethical_principles = {
            "beneficence": lambda action: action.benefit > 0,
            "non_maleficence": lambda action: action.harm == 0,
            "autonomy": lambda action: action.respects_autonomy,
            "justice": lambda action: action.is_fair
        }
    
    def evaluate_action(self, action):
        evaluations = {principle: check(action) 
                       for principle, check in self.ethical_principles.items()}
        return all(evaluations.values()), evaluations
    
    def choose_ethical_action(self, actions):
        ethical_actions = [action for action in actions 
                           if self.evaluate_action(action)[0]]
        return max(ethical_actions, key=lambda a: a.benefit) if ethical_actions else None

# Example usage
class Action:
    def __init__(self, name, benefit, harm, respects_autonomy, is_fair):
        self.name = name
        self.benefit = benefit
        self.harm = harm
        self.respects_autonomy = respects_autonomy
        self.is_fair = is_fair

agent = EthicalAgent()
actions = [
    Action("A", benefit=5, harm=0, respects_autonomy=True, is_fair=True),
    Action("B", benefit=10, harm=2, respects_autonomy=True, is_fair=False),
    Action("C", benefit=3, harm=0, respects_autonomy=True, is_fair=True)
]

chosen_action = agent.choose_ethical_action(actions)
print(f"Chosen ethical action: {chosen_action.name if chosen_action else 'None'}")
```

Slide 11: Explainable AI in Foundation Agents

Explainability is crucial for Foundation Agents to be trustworthy and understandable. This slide explores techniques for making the decision-making process of these agents more transparent and interpretable.

```python
import sklearn.tree as tree
import graphviz

class ExplainableAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
        self.feature_names = ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
        self.class_names = ["class1", "class2"]
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)
    
    def explain(self):
        dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(self.model, out_file=None, 
                                        feature_names=self.feature_names,  
                                        class_names=self.class_names,  
                                        filled=True, rounded=True,  
                                        special_characters=True)
        graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)
        return graph

# Example usage
import numpy as np

agent = ExplainableAgent()
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [2, 3, 4]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])

agent.train(X, y)
explanation = agent.explain()
explanation.render("decision_tree", format="png", cleanup=True)
print("Decision tree visualization saved as 'decision_tree.png'")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Autonomous Trading Agent

This slide presents a practical example of a Foundation Agent applied to financial trading. The agent uses market data to make informed trading decisions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TradingAgent:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=10000):
        self.balance = initial_balance
        self.portfolio = {}
    
    def analyze_market(self, market_data):
        market_data['MA5'] = market_data['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
        return market_data
    
    def make_decision(self, price, moving_average):
        return "buy" if price < moving_average else "sell"
    
    def execute_trade(self, symbol, action, price, amount=1):
        if action == "buy" and self.balance >= price * amount:
            self.balance -= price * amount
            self.portfolio[symbol] = self.portfolio.get(symbol, 0) + amount
        elif action == "sell" and self.portfolio.get(symbol, 0) >= amount:
            self.balance += price * amount
            self.portfolio[symbol] -= amount
    
    def run_simulation(self, market_data):
        analyzed_data = self.analyze_market(market_data)
        for _, row in analyzed_data.iterrows():
            action = self.make_decision(row['close'], row['MA5'])
            self.execute_trade(row['symbol'], action, row['close'])
        
        print(f"Final balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")
        print(f"Final portfolio: {self.portfolio}")

# Usage example (assuming market_data is a pandas DataFrame with columns: date, symbol, open, high, low, close)
agent = TradingAgent()
agent.run_simulation(market_data)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Smart Home Assistant

This slide showcases another practical application of Foundation Agents in the form of a smart home assistant that can control various devices and respond to user commands.

```python
import random

class SmartHomeAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.devices = {
            "living_room_light": False,
            "kitchen_light": False,
            "thermostat": 20,
            "door_lock": True
        }
    
    def process_command(self, command):
        if "turn on" in command:
            return self.turn_on_device(command)
        elif "turn off" in command:
            return self.turn_off_device(command)
        elif "set temperature" in command:
            return self.set_temperature(command)
        elif "lock" in command or "unlock" in command:
            return self.toggle_lock(command)
        else:
            return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that command."
    
    def turn_on_device(self, command):
        for device in self.devices:
            if device in command and "light" in device:
                self.devices[device] = True
                return f"{device.replace('_', ' ').title()} turned on."
        return "Device not found."
    
    def turn_off_device(self, command):
        for device in self.devices:
            if device in command and "light" in device:
                self.devices[device] = False
                return f"{device.replace('_', ' ').title()} turned off."
        return "Device not found."
    
    def set_temperature(self, command):
        try:
            temperature = int(command.split()[-1])
            self.devices["thermostat"] = temperature
            return f"Thermostat set to {temperature}°C."
        except ValueError:
            return "Invalid temperature value."
    
    def toggle_lock(self, command):
        if "unlock" in command:
            self.devices["door_lock"] = False
            return "Door unlocked."
        else:
            self.devices["door_lock"] = True
            return "Door locked."

# Usage example
agent = SmartHomeAgent()
print(agent.process_command("turn on living room light"))
print(agent.process_command("set temperature to 22"))
print(agent.process_command("unlock the door"))
```
