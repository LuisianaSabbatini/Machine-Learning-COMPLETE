## CatBoost for Wind Power Generation Prediction
Slide 1: Introduction to CatBoost for Wind Power Generation Prediction

CatBoost is a powerful gradient boosting library that has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to handle complex datasets and achieve high performance. In this presentation, we'll explore how CatBoost can be applied to predict wind power generation, a crucial task in renewable energy management. We'll also compare CatBoost with other popular machine learning models to understand its strengths and potential applications.

```python
import catboost as cb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Load wind power generation data
data = pd.read_csv('wind_power_data.csv')
X = data.drop('power_output', axis=1)
y = data['power_output']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train CatBoost model
model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and calculate R-squared
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.4f}")
```

Slide 2: Understanding CatBoost Algorithm

CatBoost, short for Categorical Boosting, is an implementation of gradient boosting that excels in handling categorical features. It builds decision trees sequentially, where each new tree attempts to correct the errors of the previous ensemble. CatBoost introduces several innovations, including symmetric trees and ordered boosting, which help reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

```python
# Visualize CatBoost's feature importance
feature_importance = model.get_feature_importance()
feature_names = X.columns
sorted_idx = np.argsort(feature_importance)
pos = np.arange(sorted_idx.shape[0]) + .5

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.barh(pos, feature_importance[sorted_idx], align='center')
plt.yticks(pos, feature_names[sorted_idx])
plt.title('Feature Importance in Wind Power Prediction')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Advantages of CatBoost in Wind Power Prediction

CatBoost offers several advantages for wind power prediction tasks. It handles categorical variables efficiently without the need for explicit encoding, which is beneficial when dealing with factors like wind direction or turbine type. The algorithm's robustness to overfitting is particularly useful in wind power prediction, where the relationship between input features and power output can be complex and nonlinear.

```python
# Demonstrate CatBoost's handling of categorical features
categorical_features = ['wind_direction', 'turbine_type']
cat_model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
cat_model.fit(X_train, y_train, cat_features=categorical_features)

# Compare performance
y_pred_cat = cat_model.predict(X_test)
r2_cat = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_cat)
print(f"R-squared with categorical features: {r2_cat:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Comparing CatBoost with Other Models

While CatBoost performs well in many scenarios, it's essential to compare it with other popular models. Let's evaluate LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest on the same wind power prediction task to understand their relative strengths.

```python
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize models
lgbm = LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=1000, random_state=42)
xgb = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, random_state=42)
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=1000, random_state=42)

# Train and evaluate models
models = [lgbm, xgb, rf]
model_names = ['LightGBM', 'XGBoost', 'Random Forest']

for model, name in zip(models, model_names):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"{name} R-squared: {r2:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: LightGBM: Speed and Efficiency

LightGBM is known for its speed and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. It uses a histogram-based algorithm for splitting, which reduces memory usage and computational cost. This can be particularly beneficial when working with high-frequency wind power data.

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
lgbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
lgbm_time = time.time() - start_time

y_pred_lgbm = lgbm.predict(X_test)
r2_lgbm = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_lgbm)

print(f"LightGBM training time: {lgbm_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"LightGBM R-squared: {r2_lgbm:.4f}")
```

Slide 6: XGBoost: Regularization and Performance

XGBoost is a highly efficient gradient boosting framework that uses regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. It's known for its speed and accuracy, making it a strong contender for wind power prediction tasks.

```python
start_time = time.time()
xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)
xgb_time = time.time() - start_time

y_pred_xgb = xgb.predict(X_test)
r2_xgb = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_xgb)

print(f"XGBoost training time: {xgb_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"XGBoost R-squared: {r2_xgb:.4f}")
```

Slide 7: Random Forest: Ensemble of Decision Trees

Random Forest is an ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. It's robust to noise and outliers, which can be advantageous when dealing with wind power data that may contain measurement errors or anomalies.

```python
start_time = time.time()
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_time = time.time() - start_time

y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)
r2_rf = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)

print(f"Random Forest training time: {rf_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Random Forest R-squared: {r2_rf:.4f}")
```

Slide 8: Ensemble Methods for Improved Predictions

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce overfitting. Let's create a simple ensemble of our models to see if we can achieve better wind power predictions.

```python
# Create a simple averaging ensemble
ensemble_pred = (y_pred + y_pred_lgbm + y_pred_xgb + y_pred_rf) / 4
r2_ensemble = r2_score(y_test, ensemble_pred)

print(f"Ensemble R-squared: {r2_ensemble:.4f}")

# Compare all models
models = ['CatBoost', 'LightGBM', 'XGBoost', 'Random Forest', 'Ensemble']
r2_scores = [r2, r2_lgbm, r2_xgb, r2_rf, r2_ensemble]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(models, r2_scores)
plt.title('Model Comparison: R-squared Scores')
plt.ylabel('R-squared')
plt.ylim(0.9, 1.0)  # Adjust as needed
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Hyperparameter Tuning for CatBoost

To maximize CatBoost's performance for wind power prediction, we can use hyperparameter tuning. Let's use grid search to find the best combination of parameters for our model.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'iterations': [500, 1000],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1],
    'depth': [4, 6, 8],
    'l2_leaf_reg': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(cb.CatBoostRegressor(random_state=42),
                           param_grid, cv=3, scoring='r2')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best R-squared:", grid_search.best_score_)

# Use the best model for predictions
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred_best = best_model.predict(X_test)
r2_best = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_best)
print(f"Best model R-squared on test set: {r2_best:.4f}")
```

Slide 10: Feature Engineering for Wind Power Prediction

Feature engineering can significantly improve model performance. Let's create some new features that might be relevant for wind power prediction, such as time-based features and rolling statistics.

```python
# Assume 'timestamp' is a column in our dataset
data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(data['timestamp'])
data['hour'] = data['timestamp'].dt.hour
data['day_of_week'] = data['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
data['month'] = data['timestamp'].dt.month

# Create rolling statistics for wind speed
data['wind_speed_rolling_mean'] = data['wind_speed'].rolling(window=24).mean()
data['wind_speed_rolling_std'] = data['wind_speed'].rolling(window=24).std()

# Update our feature set
X = data.drop(['power_output', 'timestamp'], axis=1)
y = data['power_output']

# Split the data and train the model again
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model_fe = cb.CatBoostRegressor(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
model_fe.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred_fe = model_fe.predict(X_test)
r2_fe = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_fe)
print(f"R-squared with feature engineering: {r2_fe:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Wind Farm Output Prediction

Let's apply our CatBoost model to predict the power output of a wind farm based on weather forecasts. This can help grid operators manage energy distribution more effectively.

```python
# Simulated weather forecast data for the next 24 hours
forecast_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'wind_speed': np.random.normal(8, 2, 24),
    'wind_direction': np.random.choice(['N', 'NE', 'E', 'SE', 'S', 'SW', 'W', 'NW'], 24),
    'temperature': np.random.normal(15, 5, 24),
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(40, 80, 24),
    'hour': range(24)
})

# Make predictions
power_predictions = model.predict(forecast_data)

# Visualize the predictions
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(range(24), power_predictions, marker='o')
plt.title('Predicted Wind Farm Power Output for Next 24 Hours')
plt.xlabel('Hour')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Power Output (MW)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Turbine Maintenance Scheduling

We can use our CatBoost model to optimize turbine maintenance scheduling by predicting periods of low wind power generation.

```python
# Simulated historical data for a month
dates = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-01-31', freq='H')
monthly_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'timestamp': dates,
    'wind_speed': np.random.normal(7, 3, len(dates)),
    'wind_direction': np.random.choice(['N', 'NE', 'E', 'SE', 'S', 'SW', 'W', 'NW'], len(dates)),
    'temperature': np.random.normal(10, 8, len(dates)),
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(30, 90, len(dates))
})

monthly_data['hour'] = monthly_data['timestamp'].dt.hour
monthly_data['day_of_week'] = monthly_data['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
monthly_data['month'] = monthly_data['timestamp'].dt.month

# Predict power output
power_predictions = model.predict(monthly_data.drop('timestamp', axis=1))

# Find periods of low power generation
low_power_periods = monthly_data[power_predictions < np.percentile(power_predictions, 10)]

print("Recommended maintenance periods (lowest 10% power generation):")
print(low_power_periods['timestamp'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M').head())

# Visualize power predictions
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_data['timestamp'], power_predictions)
plt.title('Predicted Power Output for January 2023')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Power Output (MW)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
