## Leveraging Feature Discretization for Non-Linear Modeling
Slide 1: Understanding Feature Discretization

Feature discretization is a technique that transforms continuous features into discrete ones, often using one-hot encoding. This process can unveil valuable insights and enable non-linear behavior in linear models. By grouping continuous data into meaningful categories, we can better understand patterns and relationships within our dataset.

Slide 2: Source Code for Understanding Feature Discretization

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer

# Create a sample dataset
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 80, 1000),
    'income': np.random.randint(20000, 150000, 1000)
})

# Discretize age into 3 bins
discretizer = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=3, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')
data['age_group'] = discretizer.fit_transform(data[['age']])

# Map age groups to meaningful labels
age_labels = {0: 'Young', 1: 'Adult', 2: 'Senior'}
data['age_group'] = data['age_group'].map(age_labels)

print(data.head())
```

Slide 3: Benefits of Feature Discretization

Feature discretization offers several advantages. It can improve model interpretability by grouping continuous variables into meaningful categories. This technique also allows linear models to capture non-linear patterns in the data, potentially leading to better accuracy. Additionally, discretization can help reduce the impact of outliers and noise in the data.

Slide 4: Source Code for Benefits of Feature Discretization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Create a non-linear relationship
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000).reshape(-1, 1)
y = (np.sin(X) > 0).astype(int).ravel()

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a logistic regression model on continuous data
model_continuous = LogisticRegression()
model_continuous.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_continuous = model_continuous.predict(X_test)

# Discretize the data
discretizer = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=10, encode='onehot-dense', strategy='uniform')
X_train_discrete = discretizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_discrete = discretizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a logistic regression model on discretized data
model_discrete = LogisticRegression()
model_discrete.fit(X_train_discrete, y_train)
y_pred_discrete = model_discrete.predict(X_test_discrete)

# Compare accuracies
print(f"Continuous accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_continuous):.4f}")
print(f"Discrete accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_discrete):.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Results for Benefits of Feature Discretization

```
Continuous accuracy: 0.5200
Discrete accuracy: 0.8550
```

Slide 6: Visualizing the Impact of Feature Discretization

To better understand the impact of feature discretization, let's visualize the decision boundaries of our models. This comparison will show how discretization allows a linear model to capture non-linear patterns in the data.

Slide 7: Source Code for Visualizing the Impact of Feature Discretization

```python
# Plotting function
def plot_decision_boundary(X, y, model, ax, title):
    xx = np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), 1000).reshape(-1, 1)
    Z = model.predict(xx if 'continuous' in title else discretizer.transform(xx))
    ax.scatter(X, y, c=y, cmap='viridis', edgecolor='black')
    ax.plot(xx, Z, color='red', linewidth=2)
    ax.set_title(title)
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('y')

# Create subplots
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Plot continuous model
plot_decision_boundary(X, y, model_continuous, ax1, "Continuous Model")

# Plot discrete model
plot_decision_boundary(X, y, model_discrete, ax2, "Discrete Model")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Customer Segmentation

Consider a retail company aiming to segment its customers based on their shopping behavior. By discretizing continuous features like purchase frequency and average order value, we can create meaningful customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

Slide 9: Source Code for Customer Segmentation Example

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer

# Create sample customer data
np.random.seed(42)
customers = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer_id': range(1000),
    'purchase_frequency': np.random.exponential(scale=2, size=1000),
    'avg_order_value': np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=20, size=1000)
})

# Discretize purchase frequency and average order value
discretizer_freq = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=3, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')
discretizer_value = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=3, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')

customers['frequency_segment'] = discretizer_freq.fit_transform(customers[['purchase_frequency']])
customers['value_segment'] = discretizer_value.fit_transform(customers[['avg_order_value']])

# Map segments to meaningful labels
freq_labels = {0: 'Low', 1: 'Medium', 2: 'High'}
value_labels = {0: 'Budget', 1: 'Mid-range', 2: 'Premium'}

customers['frequency_segment'] = customers['frequency_segment'].map(freq_labels)
customers['value_segment'] = customers['value_segment'].map(value_labels)

print(customers.head())
print("\nCustomer Segments:")
print(customers.groupby(['frequency_segment', 'value_segment']).size().unstack())
```

Slide 10: Cautionary Measures

While feature discretization can be powerful, it's important to use it judiciously. Overly discretizing features can lead to overfitting and increased data dimensionality. It's crucial to strike a balance between capturing meaningful patterns and avoiding excessive complexity in your model.

Slide 11: Source Code for Cautionary Measures

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=(1000, 1))
y = (X > 0).astype(int).ravel()

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Function to evaluate model performance
def evaluate_model(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, n_bins):
    discretizer = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=n_bins, encode='onehot-dense', strategy='uniform')
    X_train_discrete = discretizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_discrete = discretizer.transform(X_test)
    
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train_discrete, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test_discrete)
    
    return accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Evaluate models with different numbers of bins
bins_range = [2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]
accuracies = [evaluate_model(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, n_bins) for n_bins in bins_range]

# Print results
for bins, acc in zip(bins_range, accuracies):
    print(f"Bins: {bins}, Accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Results for Cautionary Measures

```
Bins: 2, Accuracy: 0.9900
Bins: 5, Accuracy: 1.0000
Bins: 10, Accuracy: 0.9950
Bins: 20, Accuracy: 0.9950
Bins: 50, Accuracy: 0.9900
Bins: 100, Accuracy: 0.9900
```

Slide 13: When to Use Feature Discretization

Feature discretization is particularly useful in certain scenarios. It can be beneficial when working with geospatial data, age-related information, or features constrained within a specific range. The key is to apply discretization when it aligns with the inherent nature of the data and the goals of your analysis.

Slide 14: Source Code for When to Use Feature Discretization

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer

# Generate sample geospatial data
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'latitude': np.random.uniform(25, 50, 1000),
    'longitude': np.random.uniform(-125, -65, 1000)
})

# Discretize latitude and longitude
discretizer_lat = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, encode='ordinal', strategy='uniform')
discretizer_lon = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, encode='ordinal', strategy='uniform')

data['lat_region'] = discretizer_lat.fit_transform(data[['latitude']])
data['lon_region'] = discretizer_lon.fit_transform(data[['longitude']])

# Define region labels
lat_labels = {0: 'South', 1: 'South-Central', 2: 'Central', 3: 'North-Central', 4: 'North'}
lon_labels = {0: 'West', 1: 'West-Central', 2: 'Central', 3: 'East-Central', 4: 'East'}

data['lat_region'] = data['lat_region'].map(lat_labels)
data['lon_region'] = data['lon_region'].map(lon_labels)

print(data.head())
print("\nRegion Distribution:")
print(data.groupby(['lat_region', 'lon_region']).size().unstack())
```
