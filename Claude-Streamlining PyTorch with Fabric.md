Slide 1: Introduction to PyTorch Fabric

PyTorch Fabric represents a revolutionary approach to distributed training, bridging the gap between PyTorch's flexibility and Lightning's simplified distributed capabilities. It enables seamless scaling from single-device training to multi-GPU setups while maintaining pure PyTorch-style control over training loops.

```python
# Traditional PyTorch training loop
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Standard training setup
model = MyModel().cuda()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)

# Training loop with device management
for batch in train_loader:
    x, y = batch
    x, y = x.cuda(), y.cuda()
    loss = model(x, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Slide 2: Setting Up Fabric Environment

Fabric initialization requires minimal code changes while providing immediate access to advanced distributed training features. The Fabric object becomes the central manager for all training-related operations, handling device placement and strategy coordination.

```python
import lightning.fabric as fabric
from lightning.fabric import Fabric

# Initialize Fabric with desired settings
fabric = Fabric(
    accelerator="cuda",
    devices=2,
    strategy="ddp",
    precision="16-mixed"
)

# Launch the fabric environment
fabric.launch()

# Fabric manages model and optimizer setup
model, optimizer = fabric.setup(model, optimizer)
train_loader = fabric.setup_dataloaders(train_loader)
```

Slide 3: Model Configuration with Fabric

The transformation to Fabric involves restructuring how models and optimizers are initialized and managed. This slide demonstrates the core setup pattern that replaces traditional PyTorch device management while maintaining full control over the training process.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from lightning.fabric import Fabric

class ModelArchitecture(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(784, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)

# Initialize Fabric and model
fabric = Fabric(accelerator="cuda", devices=2)
with fabric.device:
    model = ModelArchitecture()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Setup model and optimizer with Fabric
model, optimizer = fabric.setup(model, optimizer)
```

Slide 4: Distributed Data Loading

Fabric streamlines data loading in distributed environments by automatically handling sharding and worker initialization. This removes the complexity of manual distributed data management while ensuring efficient data processing across multiple GPUs.

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
import lightning.fabric as fabric

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, labels):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.labels[idx]

# Create dataset and dataloader
dataset = CustomDataset(data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=32,
    num_workers=4,
    shuffle=True
)

# Let Fabric handle distributed data loading
dataloader = fabric.setup_dataloaders(dataloader)
```

Slide 5: Training Loop Implementation

The training loop with Fabric maintains PyTorch's intuitive structure while abstracting away device management and distributed training complexities. This implementation shows how Fabric simplifies the training process without sacrificing control.

```python
def training_step(batch, model, optimizer, fabric):
    # Fabric handles device placement automatically
    inputs, labels = batch
    
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(outputs, labels)
    
    # Backward pass using Fabric
    fabric.backward(loss)
    
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    return loss.item()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_loader:
        loss = training_step(batch, model, optimizer, fabric)
        
        # Fabric handles distributed logging
        fabric.log("train_loss", loss)
```

## Response:
Slide 6: Mixed Precision Training

Fabric simplifies the implementation of mixed precision training, automatically handling the conversion between float32 and float16 datatypes. This optimization technique significantly reduces memory usage and accelerates training while maintaining numerical stability.

```python
# Initialize Fabric with mixed precision
fabric = Fabric(
    accelerator="cuda",
    devices=2,
    precision="16-mixed",
    strategy="ddp"
)

# Training loop with automatic mixed precision
def training_step_amp(batch, model, optimizer, fabric):
    inputs, labels = batch
    
    # Forward pass - Fabric handles precision casting
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(outputs, labels)
    
    # Backward pass with automatic scaling
    fabric.backward(loss)
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    return loss.item()
```

Slide 7: Implementing FSDP Strategy

Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a powerful distributed training strategy that Fabric makes accessible through simple configuration. This implementation demonstrates how to enable FSDP for training large models efficiently.

```python
from lightning.fabric import Fabric
from torch.distributed.fsdp import (
    FullyShardedDataParallel,
    CPUOffload
)

# Configure Fabric with FSDP strategy
fabric = Fabric(
    accelerator="cuda",
    devices=4,
    strategy="fsdp",
    precision="16-mixed"
)

# FSDP-specific configuration
fsdp_config = {
    "sharding_strategy": "FULL_SHARD",
    "cpu_offload": CPUOffload(offload_params=True),
    "mixed_precision": True
}

# Setup model with FSDP
with fabric.init():
    model = LargeTransformerModel()
    model = fabric.setup_module(model)
```

Slide 8: Checkpoint Management

Fabric provides robust checkpoint management capabilities that work seamlessly across different distributed strategies. This implementation shows how to save and load model states efficiently in a distributed environment.

```python
def save_checkpoint(fabric, model, optimizer, epoch, path):
    checkpoint = {
        "model": model.state_dict(),
        "optimizer": optimizer.state_dict(),
        "epoch": epoch
    }
    
    # Fabric handles distributed checkpoint saving
    fabric.save(path, checkpoint)

def load_checkpoint(fabric, model, optimizer, path):
    # Load checkpoint with Fabric
    checkpoint = fabric.load(path)
    
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint["model"])
    optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint["optimizer"])
    
    return checkpoint["epoch"]

# Usage in training loop
if epoch % save_frequency == 0:
    save_checkpoint(fabric, model, optimizer, epoch, f"checkpoint_{epoch}.ckpt")
```

Slide 9: Performance Monitoring

Fabric integrates seamlessly with various monitoring tools while providing built-in performance metrics tracking. This implementation demonstrates how to set up comprehensive monitoring in a distributed training environment.

```python
from lightning.fabric.loggers import TensorBoardLogger
import time

# Initialize Fabric with logger
logger = TensorBoardLogger("logs/")
fabric = Fabric(loggers=logger)

# Performance monitoring implementation
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, fabric):
        self.fabric = fabric
        self.step_times = []
        self.start_time = None
    
    def start_batch(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
    
    def end_batch(self, loss, batch_size):
        duration = time.time() - self.start_time
        self.step_times.append(duration)
        
        # Log metrics using Fabric
        self.fabric.log({
            "batch_time": duration,
            "samples_per_second": batch_size / duration,
            "loss": loss
        })

# Usage in training loop
monitor = PerformanceMonitor(fabric)
for batch in train_loader:
    monitor.start_batch()
    loss = training_step(batch, model, optimizer, fabric)
    monitor.end_batch(loss, batch.size(0))
```

    def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_length=512):
        self.encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True,
                                 max_length=max_length, return_tensors='pt')
        self.labels = labels

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: val[idx] for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
        item['labels'] = self.labels[idx]
        return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

# Initialize Fabric with mixed precision for efficient training
fabric = Fabric(
    accelerator="cuda",
    devices=2,
    precision="16-mixed",
    strategy="ddp"
)

# Model and training setup
with fabric.device:
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

# Setup with Fabric
model, optimizer = fabric.setup(model, optimizer)
train_loader = fabric.setup_dataloaders(train_loader)
```

Slide 11: Training Loop for BERT Fine-tuning

The training implementation shows how Fabric simplifies distributed training while maintaining full control over the training process, including gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling.

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LinearLR
from tqdm import tqdm

def train_epoch(fabric, model, train_loader, optimizer, scheduler):
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    
    for batch in tqdm(train_loader):
        # Move batch to device (Fabric handles this automatically)
        input_ids = batch['input_ids']
        attention_mask = batch['attention_mask']
        labels = batch['labels']
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids,
                       attention_mask=attention_mask,
                       labels=labels)
        
        loss = outputs.loss
        
        # Backward pass through Fabric
        fabric.backward(loss)
        
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Log metrics
        fabric.log("train_loss", loss.item())
        total_loss += loss.item()
    
    return total_loss / len(train_loader)

# Training execution
scheduler = LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.0,
                    total_iters=num_epochs * len(train_loader))

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    avg_loss = train_epoch(fabric, model, train_loader, optimizer, scheduler)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Average Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Implementing Gradient Accumulation

This implementation shows how to incorporate gradient accumulation with Fabric, allowing for effective training with larger batch sizes than what would fit in GPU memory.

```python
def train_with_gradient_accumulation(fabric, model, train_loader, optimizer,
                                   accumulation_steps=4):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    accumulated_loss = 0
    
    for idx, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(**batch)
        # Scale loss by accumulation steps
        loss = outputs.loss / accumulation_steps
        
        # Backward pass with Fabric
        fabric.backward(loss)
        accumulated_loss += loss.item()
        
        # Step optimizer only after accumulating gradients
        if (idx + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Log accumulated loss
            fabric.log("train_loss", accumulated_loss * accumulation_steps)
            accumulated_loss = 0
            
    return accumulated_loss

# Usage example
accumulation_steps = 4
train_with_gradient_accumulation(fabric, model, train_loader, optimizer,
                               accumulation_steps)
