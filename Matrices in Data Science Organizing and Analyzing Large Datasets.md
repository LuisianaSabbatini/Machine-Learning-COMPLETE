## Matrices in Data Science Organizing and Analyzing Large Datasets
Slide 1: Matrices in Data Science

Matrices are indeed powerful tools in data science, enabling efficient organization and analysis of large datasets. However, some aspects of the given description require clarification and expansion. Let's explore matrices in data science, their applications, and their importance more accurately.

Slide 2: Matrix Basics

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. In Python, we can represent matrices using nested lists or NumPy arrays for more efficient operations.

```python
# Creating a matrix using nested lists
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Accessing elements
print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6

# Matrix dimensions
rows = len(matrix)
cols = len(matrix[0])
print(f"Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")  # Output: Dimensions: 3x3
```

Slide 3: Data Representation with Matrices

Matrices provide a structured way to represent and store data. For example, in image processing, each pixel's color intensity can be represented as a matrix element.

```python
# Representing a grayscale image as a matrix
image = [
    [100, 150, 200],
    [50, 100, 150],
    [0, 50, 100]
]

# Displaying the image
for row in image:
    print(' '.join(f"{pixel:3d}" for pixel in row))
```

```
100 150 200
 50 100 150
  0  50 100
```

Slide 5: Matrix Operations

Basic matrix operations include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. These operations are fundamental in various data science applications.

Slide 6: Source Code for Matrix Operations

```python
def matrix_add(A, B):
    return [[A[i][j] + B[i][j] for j in range(len(A[0]))] for i in range(len(A))]

def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    return [[sum(a*b for a,b in zip(A_row,B_col)) for B_col in zip(*B)] for A_row in A]

# Example matrices
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

# Addition
C = matrix_add(A, B)
print("Matrix Addition:")
for row in C:
    print(row)

# Multiplication
D = matrix_multiply(A, B)
print("\nMatrix Multiplication:")
for row in D:
    print(row)
```

Slide 7: Results for: Matrix Operations

```
Matrix Addition:
[6, 8]
[10, 12]

Matrix Multiplication:
[19, 22]
[43, 50]
```

Slide 8: Matrices in Machine Learning

Matrices play a crucial role in machine learning algorithms. For instance, in linear regression, we use matrices to represent feature data and perform calculations efficiently.

Slide 9: Source Code for Matrices in Machine Learning

```python
def linear_regression(X, y):
    # Add bias term to X
    X = [[1] + row for row in X]
    
    # Calculate transpose of X
    X_T = list(map(list, zip(*X)))
    
    # Calculate X^T * X
    X_T_X = matrix_multiply(X_T, X)
    
    # Calculate inverse of X^T * X
    X_T_X_inv = inverse_matrix(X_T_X)
    
    # Calculate X^T * y
    X_T_y = matrix_multiply(X_T, [[yi] for yi in y])
    
    # Calculate coefficients
    coefficients = matrix_multiply(X_T_X_inv, X_T_y)
    
    return [coef[0] for coef in coefficients]

# Example data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]

coefficients = linear_regression(X, y)
print("Coefficients:", coefficients)
```

Slide 10: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that uses matrices to simplify complex datasets while preserving important information. It's widely used in various fields, including image compression and feature selection.

Slide 11: Source Code for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```python
def pca(X, num_components):
    # Center the data
    X_centered = [[x - sum(col)/len(col) for x, col in zip(row, zip(*X))] for row in X]
    
    # Compute covariance matrix
    cov_matrix = matrix_multiply(transpose(X_centered), X_centered)
    
    # Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eig(cov_matrix)
    
    # Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues in descending order
    eigen_pairs = sorted(zip(eigenvalues, eigenvectors), key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
    
    # Select top k eigenvectors
    W = [pair[1] for pair in eigen_pairs[:num_components]]
    
    # Project data onto new subspace
    return matrix_multiply(X_centered, transpose(W))

# Example usage
X = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
reduced_X = pca(X, 2)
print("Reduced data:")
for row in reduced_X:
    print(row)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Compression

Matrices are extensively used in image compression algorithms. Let's explore a simple example of compressing a grayscale image using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a matrix factorization technique.

Slide 13: Source Code for Image Compression

```python
def svd(A, k):
    # Simplified SVD implementation
    U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(A)
    return U[:, :k], S[:k], V[:k, :]

def compress_image(image, k):
    U, S, V = svd(image, k)
    compressed = np.dot(U, np.dot(np.diag(S), V))
    return np.clip(compressed, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)

# Example usage (assuming we have a grayscale image as a 2D numpy array)
original_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(100, 100))
compressed_image = compress_image(original_image, 10)

print("Original shape:", original_image.shape)
print("Compressed shape:", compressed_image.shape)
print("Compression ratio:", original_image.size / (compressed_image.shape[0] * compressed_image.shape[1] + sum(compressed_image.shape)))
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems often use matrix factorization techniques to predict user preferences. Let's implement a simple collaborative filtering algorithm using matrices.

Slide 15: Source Code for Recommendation Systems

```python
def matrix_factorization(R, P, Q, K, steps=5000, alpha=0.0002, beta=0.02):
    Q = Q.T
    for step in range(steps):
        for i in range(len(R)):
            for j in range(len(R[i])):
                if R[i][j] > 0:
                    eij = R[i][j] - np.dot(P[i,:], Q[:,j])
                    for k in range(K):
                        P[i][k] += alpha * (2 * eij * Q[k][j] - beta * P[i][k])
                        Q[k][j] += alpha * (2 * eij * P[i][k] - beta * Q[k][j])
        e = 0
        for i in range(len(R)):
            for j in range(len(R[i])):
                if R[i][j] > 0:
                    e += pow(R[i][j] - np.dot(P[i,:], Q[:,j]), 2)
                    for k in range(K):
                        e += (beta/2) * (pow(P[i][k], 2) + pow(Q[k][j], 2))
        if e < 0.001:
            break
    return P, Q.T

# Example usage
R = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 1],
    [4, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 5],
    [1, 0, 0, 4],
    [0, 1, 5, 4],
])

N = len(R)
M = len(R[0])
K = 2

P = np.random.rand(N, K)
Q = np.random.rand(M, K)

nP, nQ = matrix_factorization(R, P, Q, K)
nR = np.dot(nP, nQ.T)

print("Original Ratings:")
print(R)
print("\nPredicted Ratings:")
print(nR)
```
