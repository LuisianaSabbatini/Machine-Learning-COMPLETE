## Balancing Model Complexity! Main Tendencies vs. Overfitting in Python
Slide 1: Understanding Model Bias and Variance

In machine learning, finding the right balance between model complexity and generalization is crucial. This balance is often described in terms of bias and variance. Let's explore these concepts using Python examples.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.title('Sample Data')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Underfitting: High Bias, Low Variance

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data. It has high bias (systematic error) but low variance (sensitivity to changes in the training data).

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

# Fit a linear model (underfitting for this data)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X.reshape(-1, 1), y)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)), color='red')
plt.title('Underfitting: Linear Model')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Overfitting: Low Bias, High Variance

Overfitting happens when a model is too complex and starts to capture noise in the training data. It has low bias but high variance, performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

```python
# Fit a high-degree polynomial model (overfitting)
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=15)
X_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X.reshape(-1, 1))
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X_poly), color='red')
plt.title('Overfitting: High-Degree Polynomial')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between underfitting and overfitting. As model complexity increases, bias tends to decrease while variance increases. The goal is to find the sweet spot that minimizes both.

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Simulate bias-variance tradeoff
model_complexity = np.linspace(1, 10, 100)
bias = 1 / model_complexity
variance = np.exp(model_complexity) / 100

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(x=model_complexity, y=bias, label='Bias')
sns.lineplot(x=model_complexity, y=variance, label='Variance')
sns.lineplot(x=model_complexity, y=bias+variance, label='Total Error')
plt.xlabel('Model Complexity')
plt.ylabel('Error')
plt.title('Bias-Variance Tradeoff')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Cross-Validation: A Tool for Model Selection

Cross-validation helps us estimate how well a model will generalize to unseen data. It's crucial for finding the right balance between underfitting and overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

def evaluate_model(degree):
    poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
    X_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X.reshape(-1, 1))
    model = LinearRegression()
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_poly, y, cv=5)
    return np.mean(scores)

degrees = range(1, 20)
scores = [evaluate_model(degree) for degree in degrees]

plt.plot(degrees, scores)
plt.xlabel('Polynomial Degree')
plt.ylabel('Cross-Validation Score')
plt.title('Model Performance vs Complexity')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Regularization: Controlling Model Complexity

Regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function based on model coefficients.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso

# Ridge Regression
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge.fit(X.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Lasso Regression
lasso = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
lasso.fit(X.reshape(-1, 1), y)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, ridge.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)), label='Ridge', color='red')
plt.plot(X, lasso.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)), label='Lasso', color='green')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Ridge vs Lasso Regression')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Learning Curves: Diagnosing Bias and Variance

Learning curves show how model performance changes with increasing amounts of training data. They can help diagnose whether a model is suffering from high bias or high variance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve

def plot_learning_curve(estimator, X, y):
    train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(
        estimator, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10))
    
    train_scores_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
    test_scores_mean = np.mean(test_scores, axis=1)

    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores_mean, label='Training score')
    plt.plot(train_sizes, test_scores_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
    plt.xlabel('Training examples')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Learning Curve')
    plt.show()

plot_learning_curve(LinearRegression(), X.reshape(-1, 1), y)
```

Slide 8: Feature Engineering and Selection

Proper feature engineering and selection can help reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. Let's look at an example using the Boston Housing dataset.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression

boston = load_boston()
X, y = boston.data, boston.target

# Select top 5 features
selector = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

print("Original features:", boston.feature_names)
print("Selected features:", [boston.feature_names[i] for i in selector.get_support(indices=True)])
```

Slide 9: Ensemble Methods: Combining Models

Ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting can help reduce overfitting by combining multiple models.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

print("Random Forest RÂ² score:", rf_model.score(X_test.reshape(-1, 1), y_test))
```

Slide 10: Early Stopping: Preventing Overtraining

Early stopping is a technique used in iterative methods like neural networks to prevent overfitting by stopping training when performance on a validation set starts to degrade.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

mlp = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 100), max_iter=1000, early_stopping=True,
                   validation_fraction=0.2, random_state=42)
mlp.fit(X_train.reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

print("Number of iterations:", mlp.n_iter_)
print("Best validation score:", mlp.best_validation_score_)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Predicting House Prices

Let's apply what we've learned to a real-world problem: predicting house prices based on various features.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load and prepare the data
housing = fetch_california_housing()
X, y = housing.data, housing.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train and evaluate models
lr = LinearRegression().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0).fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

print("Linear Regression MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, lr.predict(X_test_scaled)))
print("Ridge Regression MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, ridge.predict(X_test_scaled)))
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

In image classification, overfitting can be a significant problem due to the high dimensionality of the data. Let's look at how data augmentation can help prevent overfitting in a simple CNN model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Load and prepare the data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0

# Create a simple CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Data augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

# Train the model with data augmentation
history = model.fit(datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32),
                    epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Plot training history
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Model Accuracy with Data Augmentation')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Conclusion and Best Practices

To find the right balance between underfitting and overfitting:

1. Start with simple models and gradually increase complexity.
2. Use cross-validation to estimate model performance.
3. Apply regularization techniques to control model complexity.
4. Monitor training and validation performance using learning curves.
5. Use feature selection and engineering to focus on relevant information.
6. Consider ensemble methods to combine multiple models.
7. Apply early stopping in iterative learning algorithms.
8. Use data augmentation for high-dimensional data like images.

Remember, the goal is to create models that generalize well to unseen data, not just perform well on the training set.
