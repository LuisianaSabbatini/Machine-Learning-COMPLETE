## Matrix-based Rank Adaptation (MoRA) in Python
Slide 1: 
Introduction to Matrix-based Rank Adaptation (MoRA)

Matrix-based Rank Adaptation (MoRA) is a technique used in information retrieval (IR) to improve the ranking of search results by incorporating term-term similarity information. It aims to enhance the performance of traditional vector space models by incorporating term-term co-occurrence data into the ranking process.

Slide 2: 
Vector Space Model

The vector space model is a fundamental concept in information retrieval, where documents and queries are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Each dimension corresponds to a unique term, and the values in the vector represent the term's importance or weight within the document or query.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Print the vector representation
print(X.toarray())
```

Slide 3: 
Term-Term Similarity

Term-term similarity measures the degree of co-occurrence or association between terms in a corpus. It captures the semantic relatedness between terms, which can be beneficial for improving the ranking of search results.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Create a count vectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Calculate term-term similarity using cosine similarity
term_term_sim = 1 - X.T * X / (X.sum(axis=1) * X.sum(axis=0).T)

# Print the term-term similarity matrix
print(term_term_sim.toarray())
```

Slide 4: 
MoRA: Motivation and Intuition

MoRA aims to incorporate term-term similarity information into the ranking process, enhancing the traditional vector space model. The intuition is that if two terms are semantically related, documents containing one term should receive a boost in their ranking scores for queries containing the other term.

Code:

```python
# Pseudocode for MoRA
# 1. Calculate term-term similarity matrix
# 2. Construct modified document-query similarity matrix
# 3. Use modified similarity matrix for ranking
```

Slide 5: 
MoRA: Term-Term Similarity Matrix

The first step in MoRA is to calculate the term-term similarity matrix, which captures the degree of association between terms in the corpus.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Create a count vectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

# Calculate term-term similarity using cosine similarity
term_term_sim = 1 - X.T * X / (X.sum(axis=1) * X.sum(axis=0).T)

# Print the term-term similarity matrix
print(term_term_sim.toarray())
```

Slide 6: 
MoRA: Modified Document-Query Similarity Matrix

MoRA modifies the traditional document-query similarity matrix by incorporating the term-term similarity information. This is done by multiplying the original similarity matrix with the term-term similarity matrix.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus and query
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
query = "sample document"
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
q = vectorizer.transform([query])

# Calculate the original document-query similarity matrix
orig_sim = X * q.T.tocsr()

# Apply MoRA to modify the similarity matrix
modified_sim = term_term_sim * orig_sim

# Print the modified document-query similarity matrix
print(modified_sim.toarray())
```

Slide 7: 
MoRA: Ranking Documents

After modifying the document-query similarity matrix using MoRA, the ranking of documents can be performed based on the updated similarity scores.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus and query
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
query = "sample document"
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
q = vectorizer.transform([query])

# Apply MoRA to modify the similarity matrix
modified_sim = term_term_sim * (X * q.T.tocsr())

# Rank the documents based on the modified similarity scores
ranked_docs = modified_sim.toarray().ravel().argsort()[::-1]

# Print the ranked document indices
print("Ranked document indices:", ranked_docs)
```

Slide 8: 
MoRA: Advantages and Limitations

MoRA offers several advantages, such as improved ranking quality and better handling of synonyms and related terms. However, it also has limitations, including increased computational complexity and potential performance degradation for certain types of queries or corpora.

Code:

```python
# Pseudocode for MoRA advantages and limitations

# Advantages:
# - Improved ranking quality
# - Better handling of synonyms and related terms
# - Can capture semantic relationships between terms

# Limitations:
# - Increased computational complexity
# - Performance may degrade for certain types of queries or corpora
# - Requires careful parameter tuning
```

Slide 9: 
MoRA: Parameter Tuning

MoRA involves several parameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance, such as the term weighting scheme (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25), the similarity measure used for term-term similarity, and the method for combining the original and modified similarity matrices.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus and query
corpus = ["This is a sample document.", "Another document for example."]
query = "sample document"
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
q = vectorizer.transform([query])

# Calculate term-term similarity using cosine similarity
term_term_sim = 1 - X.T * X / (X.sum(axis=1) * X.sum(axis=0).T)

# Combine the original and modified similarity matrices
alpha = 0.5  # Tuning parameter
modified_sim = alpha * term_term_sim * (X * q.T.tocsr()) + (1 - alpha) * (X * q.T.tocsr())

# Print the modified document-query similarity matrix
print(modified_sim.toarray())
```

Slide 10: 
MoRA: Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of MoRA, various IR evaluation metrics can be used, such as precision, recall, mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). These metrics measure the quality of the ranking and the ability to retrieve relevant documents.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, ndcg_score

# Assume relevant_docs is a list of indices of relevant documents
# and ranked_docs is a list of ranked document indices

# Calculate precision
precision = precision_score(relevant_docs, ranked_docs[:len(relevant_docs)])
print("Precision:", precision)

# Calculate recall
recall = recall_score(relevant_docs, ranked_docs[:len(relevant_docs)])
print("Recall:", recall)

# Calculate NDCG
ndcg = ndcg_score([relevant_docs], [ranked_docs])
print("NDCG:", ndcg)
```

Slide 11: 
MoRA: Applications and Use Cases

MoRA has been applied in various domains, including web search engines, document retrieval systems, and recommendation systems. It has proven beneficial in scenarios where capturing term-term relationships and semantic similarities can enhance the ranking quality of search results.

Code:

```python
# Example application: Web search engine
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the corpus (web pages) and query
corpus = ["Page about computer science.", "Another page on programming."]
query = "computer science courses"
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
q = vectorizer.transform([query])

# Apply MoRA to modify the similarity matrix
modified_sim = term_term_sim * (X * q.T.tocsr())

# Rank the web pages based on the modified similarity scores
ranked_pages = modified_sim.toarray().ravel().argsort()[::-1]

# Print the ranked page indices
print("Ranked page indices:", ranked_pages)
```

Slide 12: 
MoRA: Extensions and Variants

MoRA has inspired several extensions and variants, such as cluster-based retrieval models, latent semantic analysis (LSA), and topic models. These approaches aim to further improve the representation of documents and queries, capturing higher-level semantic relationships.

Code:

```python
# Pseudocode for a cluster-based retrieval model inspired by MoRA

# 1. Cluster documents based on term-term similarity
# 2. Calculate cluster-term and cluster-query similarities
# 3. Rank documents based on cluster-query similarities
# 4. Refine ranking using MoRA within each cluster
```

Slide 13: 
MoRA: Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its advantages, MoRA faces challenges such as computational complexity, scalability issues for large corpora, and the potential for topic drift or query drift. Future research directions include improving efficiency, exploring advanced term-term similarity measures, and integrating MoRA with other IR techniques like learning to rank.

Code:

```python
# Pseudocode for potential future directions

# 1. Develop efficient algorithms for term-term similarity computation
# 2. Explore advanced term-term similarity measures (e.g., word embeddings)
# 3. Integrate MoRA with learning to rank models
# 4. Address scalability issues for large corpora
# 5. Mitigate potential topic drift or query drift issues
```
