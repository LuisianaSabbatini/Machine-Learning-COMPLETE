## Impact of Min Samples Leaf on Tree-Based Model Performance
Slide 1: Understanding Min Samples Leaf in Tree-Based Models

Min Samples Leaf is a crucial hyperparameter in tree-based models that significantly impacts model performance. It defines the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node, influencing the tree's depth and complexity. Let's explore its effects through practical examples and code.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a sample dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a decision tree with default min_samples_leaf
dt_default = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt_default.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Default tree depth: {dt_default.get_depth()}")
print(f"Default tree accuracy: {dt_default.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")

# Create a decision tree with min_samples_leaf=50
dt_min_samples = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=50, random_state=42)
dt_min_samples.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Tree depth with min_samples_leaf=50: {dt_min_samples.get_depth()}")
print(f"Tree accuracy with min_samples_leaf=50: {dt_min_samples.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 2: The Impact of Min Samples Leaf on Tree Depth

Min Samples Leaf directly affects the depth and complexity of decision trees. A smaller value allows for deeper trees with more specific decision boundaries, while a larger value results in shallower trees with more generalized decisions. This trade-off between specificity and generalization is crucial for model performance.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

min_samples_range = range(1, 51, 5)
depths = []
accuracies = []

for min_samples in min_samples_range:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
    depths.append(dt.get_depth())
    accuracies.append(dt.score(X_test, y_test))

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(min_samples_range, depths)
plt.xlabel('Min Samples Leaf')
plt.ylabel('Tree Depth')
plt.title('Tree Depth vs Min Samples Leaf')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(min_samples_range, accuracies)
plt.xlabel('Min Samples Leaf')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Accuracy vs Min Samples Leaf')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Overfitting and Underfitting: Finding the Right Balance

Min Samples Leaf helps control overfitting and underfitting. A small value may lead to overfitting, where the model learns noise in the training data. A large value may cause underfitting, where the model fails to capture important patterns. Finding the optimal value is key to achieving good generalization.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve
import numpy as np

def plot_learning_curve(estimator, title, X, y, ylim=None, cv=None,
                        n_jobs=None, train_sizes=np.linspace(.1, 1.0, 5)):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.title(title)
    if ylim is not None:
        plt.ylim(*ylim)
    plt.xlabel("Training examples")
    plt.ylabel("Score")
    
    train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(
        estimator, X, y, cv=cv, n_jobs=n_jobs, train_sizes=train_sizes)
    train_scores_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
    train_scores_std = np.std(train_scores, axis=1)
    test_scores_mean = np.mean(test_scores, axis=1)
    test_scores_std = np.std(test_scores, axis=1)
    
    plt.grid()
    plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_scores_mean - train_scores_std,
                     train_scores_mean + train_scores_std, alpha=0.1, color="r")
    plt.fill_between(train_sizes, test_scores_mean - test_scores_std,
                     test_scores_mean + test_scores_std, alpha=0.1, color="g")
    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores_mean, 'o-', color="r", label="Training score")
    plt.plot(train_sizes, test_scores_mean, 'o-', color="g", label="Cross-validation score")
    plt.legend(loc="best")
    return plt

# Plot learning curves for different min_samples_leaf values
for min_samples in [1, 10, 50]:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    plot_learning_curve(dt, f"Learning Curve (min_samples_leaf={min_samples})", X, y, ylim=(0.7, 1.01), cv=5)
    plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Real-Life Example: Predicting Customer Churn

Let's apply our understanding of Min Samples Leaf to a real-world scenario: predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. We'll use the Telco Customer Churn dataset to demonstrate how adjusting this parameter affects model performance.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load and preprocess the data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/master/data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')
df = df.drop(['customerID'], axis=1)
df['TotalCharges'] = pd.to_numeric(df['TotalCharges'], errors='coerce')
df = df.dropna()

# Encode categorical variables
le = LabelEncoder()
for column in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
    df[column] = le.fit_transform(df[column])

X = df.drop('Churn', axis=1)
y = df['Churn']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train models with different min_samples_leaf values
min_samples_values = [1, 10, 50, 100]
for min_samples in min_samples_values:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_accuracy = dt.score(X_train, y_train)
    test_accuracy = dt.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Min Samples Leaf: {min_samples}")
    print(f"Train Accuracy: {train_accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"Tree Depth: {dt.get_depth()}\n")
```

Slide 5: Visualizing Decision Boundaries

To better understand how Min Samples Leaf affects decision-making, let's visualize decision boundaries for a simple 2D dataset. We'll compare boundaries created by trees with different Min Samples Leaf values.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Create a 2D dataset for visualization
X_2d, y_2d = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, 
                                 n_informative=2, random_state=1, n_clusters_per_class=1)

def plot_decision_boundary(X, y, model, title):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
    x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1
    y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.1),
                         np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.1))
    Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
    plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)
    plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, alpha=0.8)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()

for min_samples in [1, 10, 50]:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_2d, y_2d)
    plot_decision_boundary(X_2d, y_2d, dt, f"Decision Boundary (min_samples_leaf={min_samples})")
```

Slide 6: Feature Importance and Min Samples Leaf

Min Samples Leaf can influence which features the model considers most important. Let's examine how changing this parameter affects feature importance in our customer churn prediction model.

```python
import seaborn as sns

def plot_feature_importance(model, X, title):
    feature_importance = model.feature_importances_
    feature_importance = 100.0 * (feature_importance / feature_importance.max())
    sorted_idx = np.argsort(feature_importance)
    pos = np.arange(sorted_idx.shape[0]) + .5

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.barh(pos, feature_importance[sorted_idx], align='center')
    plt.yticks(pos, X.columns[sorted_idx])
    plt.xlabel('Relative Importance')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()

for min_samples in [1, 10, 50]:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
    plot_feature_importance(dt, X_train, f"Feature Importance (min_samples_leaf={min_samples})")
```

Slide 7: Cross-Validation for Optimal Min Samples Leaf

To find the optimal Min Samples Leaf value, we can use cross-validation. This technique helps us assess how well our model generalizes to unseen data across different parameter values.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'min_samples_leaf': range(1, 51, 5)}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best cross-validation score:", grid_search.best_score_)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(param_grid['min_samples_leaf'], grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score'])
plt.xlabel('min_samples_leaf')
plt.ylabel('Mean cross-validation score')
plt.title('Cross-validation scores for different min_samples_leaf values')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Min Samples Leaf in Random Forests

Min Samples Leaf is not limited to single decision trees; it's also an important parameter in ensemble methods like Random Forests. Let's compare its impact on a Random Forest model.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def evaluate_random_forest(min_samples_leaf):
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf, random_state=42)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_score = rf.score(X_train, y_train)
    test_score = rf.score(X_test, y_test)
    return train_score, test_score

min_samples_values = [1, 5, 10, 20, 50]
train_scores, test_scores = zip(*[evaluate_random_forest(m) for m in min_samples_values])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(min_samples_values, train_scores, label='Train Score')
plt.plot(min_samples_values, test_scores, label='Test Score')
plt.xlabel('min_samples_leaf')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Random Forest Performance vs min_samples_leaf')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Predicting Soil Types

Let's apply our knowledge of Min Samples Leaf to another real-world scenario: predicting soil types based on various soil properties. This example demonstrates how adjusting the Min Samples Leaf parameter can affect model performance in environmental science applications.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic soil data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=5, n_classes=4, 
                           n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0, 
                           random_state=42)

# Assign meaningful names to features and classes
feature_names = ['pH', 'Organic Matter', 'Sand Content', 'Clay Content', 'Moisture']
soil_types = ['Sandy', 'Clay', 'Loamy', 'Silty']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

min_samples_values = [1, 5, 10, 20, 50]
train_scores = []
test_scores = []

for min_samples in min_samples_values:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_scores.append(dt.score(X_train, y_train))
    test_scores.append(dt.score(X_test, y_test))

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(min_samples_values, train_scores, label='Train Score')
plt.plot(min_samples_values, test_scores, label='Test Score')
plt.xlabel('min_samples_leaf')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Soil Type Prediction Performance vs min_samples_leaf')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Print feature importances for the best model
best_min_samples = min_samples_values[np.argmax(test_scores)]
best_dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=best_min_samples, random_state=42)
best_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

for feature, importance in zip(feature_names, best_dt.feature_importances_):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 10: Handling Imbalanced Datasets with Min Samples Leaf

Min Samples Leaf can be particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. By setting a minimum number of samples in leaf nodes, we can prevent the model from creating branches that only represent a tiny minority of the data.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

# Generate an imbalanced dataset
X_imb, y_imb = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.9, 0.1],
                                   n_informative=3, n_redundant=1, flip_y=0,
                                   n_features=20, random_state=42)

X_train_imb, X_test_imb, y_train_imb, y_test_imb = train_test_split(X_imb, y_imb, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train models with different min_samples_leaf values
min_samples_values = [1, 10, 50]
for min_samples in min_samples_values:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X_train_imb, y_train_imb)
    y_pred = dt.predict(X_test_imb)
    
    print(f"\nmin_samples_leaf = {min_samples}")
    print(classification_report(y_test_imb, y_pred))
    
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_imb, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
    plt.title(f'Confusion Matrix (min_samples_leaf = {min_samples})')
    plt.ylabel('True label')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')
    plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Min Samples Leaf and Model Interpretability

The Min Samples Leaf parameter can significantly affect the interpretability of decision tree models. Larger values tend to produce simpler, more interpretable trees, while smaller values can lead to more complex trees that may be harder to understand.

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

# Function to visualize decision trees
def visualize_tree(model, feature_names, class_names):
    plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
    plot_tree(model, feature_names=feature_names, class_names=class_names, 
              filled=True, rounded=True, fontsize=10)
    plt.show()

# Create sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5, n_informative=3, 
                           n_redundant=0, n_classes=2, random_state=42)
feature_names = [f'Feature_{i}' for i in range(5)]
class_names = ['Class_0', 'Class_1']

# Train and visualize trees with different min_samples_leaf values
for min_samples in [1, 10]:
    dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    dt.fit(X, y)
    print(f"Tree depth (min_samples_leaf={min_samples}): {dt.get_depth()}")
    visualize_tree(dt, feature_names, class_names)
```

Slide 12: Min Samples Leaf in Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, also use the concept of Min Samples Leaf (though sometimes under different names). Let's explore how this parameter affects a gradient boosting model.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Prepare data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train models with different min_samples_leaf values
min_samples_values = [1, 5, 10, 20, 50]
accuracies = []

for min_samples in min_samples_values:
    gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples, random_state=42)
    gb.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = gb.predict(X_test)
    accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(min_samples_values, accuracies, marker='o')
plt.xlabel('min_samples_leaf')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Gradient Boosting: Accuracy vs min_samples_leaf')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Practical Tips for Tuning Min Samples Leaf

When tuning the Min Samples Leaf parameter, consider these practical tips:

1. Start with a small value (1 or 2) and gradually increase it.
2. Use cross-validation to find the optimal value for your specific dataset.
3. Consider the size of your dataset - larger datasets may benefit from larger Min Samples Leaf values.
4. Balance model complexity with performance - a larger Min Samples Leaf often leads to simpler models.
5. For imbalanced datasets, set Min Samples Leaf to ensure representation of minority classes.
6. Monitor both training and validation performance to avoid overfitting.

Slide 14: Practical Tips for Tuning Min Samples Leaf

```python
# Pseudocode for parameter tuning
def tune_min_samples_leaf(X, y):
    min_samples_range = range(1, 51, 5)
    best_score = 0
    best_min_samples = 1
    
    for min_samples in min_samples_range:
        model = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=min_samples)
        scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
        avg_score = np.mean(scores)
        
        if avg_score > best_score:
            best_score = avg_score
            best_min_samples = min_samples
    
    return best_min_samples, best_score
```

Slide 15: Conclusion and Best Practices
