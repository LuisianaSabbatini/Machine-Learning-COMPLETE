## Tropical Algebra for Dynamic Systems in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Tropical Algebra

Tropical algebra is a branch of mathematics that operates on the max-plus semiring. It has applications in various fields, including optimization, graph theory, and dynamic systems. Let's explore the basics of tropical algebra using Python.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_add(a, b):
    return max(a, b)

def tropical_multiply(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example operations
x, y = 3, 5
print(f"Tropical addition: {tropical_add(x, y)}")
print(f"Tropical multiplication: {tropical_multiply(x, y)}")
```

Slide 2: The Max-Plus Semiring

The max-plus semiring is the foundation of tropical algebra. It consists of the set of real numbers extended with negative infinity, with 'max' as addition and '+' as multiplication.

```python
import math

class MaxPlusSemiring:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value if value != float('-inf') else -math.inf
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return MaxPlusSemiring(max(self.value, other.value))
    
    def __mul__(self, other):
        return MaxPlusSemiring(self.value + other.value)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value) if self.value != -math.inf else "-∞"

# Example usage
a = MaxPlusSemiring(3)
b = MaxPlusSemiring(5)
print(f"a + b = {a + b}")
print(f"a * b = {a * b}")
```

Slide 3: Tropical Matrix Operations

Tropical matrix operations are essential for analyzing dynamic systems. Let's implement tropical matrix addition and multiplication.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_matrix_add(A, B):
    return np.maximum(A, B)

def tropical_matrix_multiply(A, B):
    rows_A, cols_A = A.shape
    rows_B, cols_B = B.shape
    
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication")
    
    C = np.full((rows_A, cols_B), float('-inf'))
    
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            C[i, j] = max(A[i, k] + B[k, j] for k in range(cols_A))
    
    return C

# Example usage
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print("Tropical matrix addition:")
print(tropical_matrix_add(A, B))

print("\nTropical matrix multiplication:")
print(tropical_matrix_multiply(A, B))
```

Slide 4: Tropical Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Tropical eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in analyzing the long-term behavior of dynamic systems. Let's implement a function to compute them.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_eigenvalue(A):
    n = A.shape[0]
    cycles = []
    
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        for i in range(n):
            cycle_weight = sum(A[i, j] for j in range(k))
            cycles.append(cycle_weight / k)
    
    return max(cycles)

def tropical_eigenvector(A, eigenvalue):
    n = A.shape[0]
    v = np.zeros(n)
    
    for i in range(n):
        v[i] = max(A[i, j] - eigenvalue * j for j in range(n))
    
    return v

# Example usage
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
eigenvalue = tropical_eigenvalue(A)
eigenvector = tropical_eigenvector(A, eigenvalue)

print(f"Tropical eigenvalue: {eigenvalue}")
print(f"Tropical eigenvector: {eigenvector}")
```

Slide 5: Tropical Polynomials

Tropical polynomials are an essential concept in tropical algebra. They behave differently from classical polynomials due to the max-plus operations.

```python
import numpy as np

class TropicalPolynomial:
    def __init__(self, coefficients):
        self.coefficients = np.array(coefficients)
    
    def evaluate(self, x):
        return max(coef + i * x for i, coef in enumerate(self.coefficients))
    
    def __str__(self):
        terms = [f"{coef}⊕{i}⊗x" for i, coef in enumerate(self.coefficients) if coef != float('-inf')]
        return " ⊕ ".join(terms)

# Example usage
poly = TropicalPolynomial([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(f"Tropical polynomial: {poly}")
x = 2
print(f"Evaluation at x = {x}: {poly.evaluate(x)}")
```

Slide 6: Tropical Linear Systems

Solving tropical linear systems is crucial for many applications in dynamic systems. Let's implement a function to solve Ax = b in the tropical sense.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_linear_solve(A, b):
    n = A.shape[0]
    x = np.full(n, float('-inf'))
    
    for i in range(n):
        x[i] = min(b[j] - A[j, i] for j in range(n) if A[j, i] != float('-inf'))
    
    return x

# Example usage
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
b = np.array([10, 11, 12])

solution = tropical_linear_solve(A, b)
print("Solution to the tropical linear system:")
print(solution)

# Verify the solution
result = tropical_matrix_multiply(A, solution.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
print("\nVerification (A ⊗ x):")
print(result)
print("\nOriginal b:")
print(b)
```

Slide 7: Tropical Convex Hull

The tropical convex hull is an important concept in tropical geometry. It has applications in optimization and decision-making processes.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_convex_hull(points):
    n, d = points.shape
    hull = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # Compute the tropical line segment between points i and j
            segment = np.maximum(points[i], points[j])
            hull.append(segment)
    
    return np.array(hull)

# Example usage
points = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
hull = tropical_convex_hull(points)

print("Original points:")
print(points)
print("\nTropical convex hull:")
print(hull)
```

Slide 8: Tropical Optimization

Tropical optimization is useful for solving problems in scheduling, resource allocation, and network analysis. Let's implement a simple tropical linear programming solver.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_linear_program(c, A, b):
    m, n = A.shape
    x = np.full(n, float('-inf'))
    
    for j in range(n):
        x[j] = min(b[i] - A[i, j] for i in range(m) if A[i, j] != float('-inf'))
    
    objective = max(c[j] + x[j] for j in range(n))
    return x, objective

# Example usage
c = np.array([1, 2, 3])
A = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
b = np.array([10, 11, 12])

solution, objective = tropical_linear_program(c, A, b)
print("Optimal solution:")
print(solution)
print(f"Objective value: {objective}")
```

Slide 9: Tropical Graph Theory

Tropical algebra has applications in graph theory, particularly for shortest path problems. Let's implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm using tropical operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_floyd_warshall(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = np.array(graph, dtype=float)
    
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
    
    return dist

# Example usage
graph = [
    [0, 3, float('inf'), 7],
    [8, 0, 2, float('inf')],
    [5, float('inf'), 0, 1],
    [2, float('inf'), float('inf'), 0]
]

shortest_paths = tropical_floyd_warshall(graph)
print("All-pairs shortest paths:")
print(shortest_paths)
```

Slide 10: Tropical Automata

Tropical automata are finite-state machines operating in the tropical semiring. They have applications in speech recognition and natural language processing.

```python
import numpy as np

class TropicalAutomaton:
    def __init__(self, transitions, initial, final):
        self.transitions = np.array(transitions)
        self.initial = np.array(initial)
        self.final = np.array(final)
    
    def run(self, input_sequence):
        state = self.initial
        for symbol in input_sequence:
            state = np.max(state + self.transitions[:, :, symbol], axis=1)
        return np.max(state + self.final)

# Example usage
transitions = np.array([
    [[0, 1], [2, 3]],
    [[4, 5], [6, 7]]
])
initial = np.array([0, float('-inf')])
final = np.array([0, 0])

automaton = TropicalAutomaton(transitions, initial, final)
input_sequence = [0, 1, 0]
result = automaton.run(input_sequence)
print(f"Result for input sequence {input_sequence}: {result}")
```

Slide 11: Tropical Time Series Analysis

Tropical algebra can be applied to time series analysis, particularly for pattern recognition and trend detection. Let's implement a simple tropical moving average.

```python
import numpy as np

def tropical_moving_average(data, window_size):
    n = len(data)
    result = np.zeros(n - window_size + 1)
    
    for i in range(n - window_size + 1):
        window = data[i:i+window_size]
        result[i] = np.max(window)
    
    return result

# Example usage
time_series = np.array([1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6])
window_size = 3

tropical_ma = tropical_moving_average(time_series, window_size)
print("Original time series:", time_series)
print(f"Tropical moving average (window size {window_size}):", tropical_ma)
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Project Scheduling

Tropical algebra can be applied to project scheduling problems. Let's use it to find the earliest start times for tasks in a project.

```python
import numpy as np

def earliest_start_times(dependencies, durations):
    n = len(durations)
    A = np.full((n, n), float('-inf'))
    
    for i, deps in enumerate(dependencies):
        for j in deps:
            A[i, j] = durations[j]
    
    x = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        x[i] = max(x[j] + A[i, j] for j in range(n))
    
    return x

# Example project
tasks = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
dependencies = [[], [0], [0], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
durations = [3, 4, 2, 5, 3]

start_times = earliest_start_times(dependencies, durations)

print("Task\tEarliest Start Time")
for task, start_time in zip(tasks, start_times):
    print(f"{task}\t{start_time}")
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Network Routing

Tropical algebra can be used to solve shortest path problems in network routing. Let's implement Dijkstra's algorithm using tropical operations.

```python
import heapq

def tropical_dijkstra(graph, start):
    n = len(graph)
    distances = [float('inf')] * n
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current_dist > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in enumerate(graph[current_node]):
            if weight != float('inf'):
                distance = max(current_dist, weight)
                if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example network
network = [
    [0, 5, float('inf'), 2],
    [5, 0, 3, float('inf')],
    [float('inf'), 3, 0, 4],
    [2, float('inf'), 4, 0]
]

start_node = 0
shortest_paths = tropical_dijkstra(network, start_node)

print(f"Shortest paths from node {start_node}:")
for node, distance in enumerate(shortest_paths):
    print(f"To node {node}: {distance}")
```

Slide 14: Conclusion and Future Directions
