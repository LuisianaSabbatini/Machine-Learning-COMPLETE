## Developing AI Technology Literacy! Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn
Slide 1: AI Technology Literacy: Separating Fact from Fiction

AI technology literacy is crucial in today's digital world. It involves understanding, evaluating, and using AI systems ethically and safely. This presentation aims to clarify misconceptions and provide a balanced view of AI capabilities and limitations.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data on AI literacy components
components = ['Critical Thinking', 'Technical Knowledge', 'Ethical Awareness', 'Practical Skills']
importance = [0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2]

# Create a pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.pie(importance, labels=components, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title('Components of AI Literacy')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Debunking AI Myths: The Human Brain Analogy

The comparison between AI and the human brain is often misleading. While neural networks are inspired by biological neurons, they function very differently from the human brain.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
y = sigmoid(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sigmoid Activation Function')
plt.xlabel('Input')
plt.ylabel('Output')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

print("This sigmoid function is a common activation in neural networks,")
print("but it's a vast simplification compared to biological neurons.")
```

Slide 3: Understanding Machine Learning: Beyond "Training"

Machine learning doesn't involve "training" in the human sense. Instead, it's a process of mathematical optimization based on data.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(f"Model coefficients: {model.coef_}")
print(f"Model intercept: {model.intercept_}")
print("This 'training' is really just finding the best-fit line.")
```

Slide 4: The Reality of AI "Intelligence"

AI systems don't possess human-like intelligence or understanding. They excel at pattern recognition and statistical analysis but lack true comprehension.

```python
import random

def chatbot_response(input_text):
    responses = [
        "That's interesting. Can you tell me more?",
        "I see. How does that make you feel?",
        "Interesting perspective. What led you to that conclusion?",
        "I understand. What do you think about that?"
    ]
    return random.choice(responses)

user_input = "I'm feeling happy today!"
print(f"User: {user_input}")
print(f"Chatbot: {chatbot_response(user_input)}")
print("Note: This simple chatbot doesn't understand the input.")
print("It just provides a random, generic response.")
```

Slide 5: Large Language Models: Sophisticated Pattern Matching

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are not reasoning engines but complex pattern-matching systems trained on vast amounts of text data.

```python
import random

def simple_text_generation(prompt, word_list, num_words):
    generated_text = prompt
    for _ in range(num_words):
        generated_text += " " + random.choice(word_list)
    return generated_text

word_list = ["AI", "language", "model", "text", "generation", "pattern", "matching"]
prompt = "Large language models perform"

generated_text = simple_text_generation(prompt, word_list, 5)
print(f"Generated text: {generated_text}")
print("This simplistic example illustrates how LLMs work at a basic level:")
print("they predict the next word based on patterns in training data.")
```

Slide 6: AI Ethics and Bias: A Critical Concern

AI systems can perpetuate and amplify societal biases present in their training data. Understanding and mitigating these biases is crucial for responsible AI development.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Simulated biased dataset
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 1).astype(int)
# Introduce bias
y[X[:, 0] > 0.8] = 1

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Check for bias
feature_importance = abs(model.coef_[0])
print(f"Feature importance: {feature_importance}")
print("A large difference in feature importance may indicate bias.")
```

Slide 7: Real-world Example: Image Recognition Limitations

Image recognition AI can be easily fooled by adversarial examples, highlighting the difference between machine pattern recognition and human understanding.

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def add_noise(image, noise_factor=0.1):
    noisy_image = image + noise_factor * np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=image.shape)
    return np.clip(noisy_image, 0, 1)

# Create a simple image
image = np.zeros((100, 100, 3))
image[25:75, 25:75, 0] = 1  # Red square

# Add noise
noisy_image = add_noise(image)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title("Original Image")
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(noisy_image)
plt.title("Image with Adversarial Noise")
plt.show()

print("Even slight noise can drastically change AI image recognition results,")
print("while humans can easily recognize the original shape.")
```

Slide 8: Generative AI: Creative Tool, Not Creative Intelligence

Generative AI produces content based on patterns in training data, not through understanding or creativity in the human sense.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simple_fractal(size, max_iter):
    def mandelbrot(h, w, max_iter):
        y, x = np.ogrid[-1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j]
        c = x + y*1j
        z = c
        divtime = max_iter + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)
        for i in range(max_iter):
            z = z**2 + c
            diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2
            div_now = diverge & (divtime == max_iter)
            divtime[div_now] = i
            z[diverge] = 2
        return divtime

    return mandelbrot(size, size, max_iter)

fractal = simple_fractal(500, 50)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.imshow(fractal, cmap='hot', extent=[-2, 0.8, -1.4, 1.4])
plt.title("Simple Fractal Generation")
plt.show()

print("This fractal is generated by a simple mathematical formula,")
print("similar to how generative AI creates content from patterns,")
print("without true understanding or creativity.")
```

Slide 9: AI Decision-Making: Probabilistic, Not Reasoned

AI decision-making is based on statistical probabilities, not logical reasoning or understanding of context.

```python
import random

def ai_decision(data, threshold):
    score = sum(data) / len(data)
    decision = "Accept" if score > threshold else "Reject"
    return decision, score

# Simulating some data points
data = [random.uniform(0, 1) for _ in range(10)]
threshold = 0.6

decision, score = ai_decision(data, threshold)

print(f"Data points: {data}")
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
print(f"Score: {score:.2f}")
print("\nThis simplistic decision-making process illustrates how AI")
print("makes choices based on numerical thresholds, not understanding.")
```

Slide 10: The Importance of Data Quality in AI

The quality and representativeness of training data significantly impact AI system performance and fairness.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate biased data
np.random.seed(0)
X_biased = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_biased = 2 * X_biased + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)
y_biased[X_biased[:, 0] > 5] += 5  # Introduce bias

# Train model on biased data
model_biased = LinearRegression()
model_biased.fit(X_biased, y_biased)

# Generate unbiased data
X_unbiased = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_unbiased = 2 * X_unbiased + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Train model on unbiased data
model_unbiased = LinearRegression()
model_unbiased.fit(X_unbiased, y_unbiased)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.scatter(X_biased, y_biased, color='red', alpha=0.5, label='Biased Data')
plt.scatter(X_unbiased, y_unbiased, color='blue', alpha=0.5, label='Unbiased Data')
plt.plot(X_biased, model_biased.predict(X_biased), color='red', label='Biased Model')
plt.plot(X_unbiased, model_unbiased.predict(X_unbiased), color='blue', label='Unbiased Model')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Impact of Data Quality on AI Model Performance')
plt.xlabel('Input')
plt.ylabel('Output')
plt.show()

print("The red line shows how biased data leads to a skewed model,")
print("while the blue line represents a more accurate model from unbiased data.")
```

Slide 11: Real-world Example: AI in Healthcare

AI in healthcare demonstrates both the potential and limitations of current AI technology. While it can assist in diagnosis and treatment planning, it cannot replace human medical expertise.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Simulated medical data (features: age, blood pressure, cholesterol)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 3) * 100
y = (X[:, 0] > 50) & (X[:, 1] > 120) & (X[:, 2] > 200)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
print("\nThis simplified example shows how AI can assist in medical diagnosis,")
print("but it's crucial to remember that such models should only support,")
print("not replace, professional medical judgment.")
```

Slide 12: The Future of AI: Potential and Limitations

As AI technology advances, it's crucial to maintain a realistic understanding of its capabilities and limitations, focusing on how it can augment human intelligence rather than replace it.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for visualization
years = np.arange(2020, 2031)
ai_capability = 2 ** (years - 2020)  # Exponential growth
human_augmentation = 10 * (years - 2020)  # Linear growth

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(years, ai_capability, label='AI Capability (Exponential)')
plt.plot(years, human_augmentation, label='Human+AI Augmentation (Linear)')
plt.title('Projected AI Capability vs Human+AI Augmentation')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Relative Capability')
plt.legend()
plt.yscale('log')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

print("This graph illustrates a hypothetical scenario where AI capabilities")
print("grow exponentially, while human+AI augmentation grows linearly.")
print("The key is to focus on how AI can enhance human capabilities,")
print("rather than trying to replicate human intelligence entirely.")
```

Slide 13: Developing AI Literacy: Key Steps

Developing AI literacy involves critical thinking, continuous learning, and hands-on experience with AI tools and concepts.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

steps = ['Understand Basics', 'Learn Data Science', 'Explore AI Ethics',
         'Practice Critical Thinking', 'Stay Updated', 'Hands-on Projects']
importance = [0.2, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.bar(steps, importance)
plt.title('Key Steps in Developing AI Literacy')
plt.ylabel('Relative Importance')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Developing AI literacy is an ongoing process that involves")
print("multiple interconnected steps. The most crucial aspects are")
print("understanding the basics and practicing critical thinking.")
```
