## Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. It's the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, improving their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y = 0.5 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.5

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(X, 0.5 * X + 1, color='red', label='True function')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Machine Learning: Fitting a Line to Data')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into three main types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. In Supervised Learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data, trying to find patterns or structures. Reinforcement Learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward.

```python
# Supervised Learning: Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted line')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Supervised Learning: Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning pipeline. It involves cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into a format that's suitable for machine learning algorithms. This process can include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Create sample data with missing values
data = np.array([[1, 2, np.nan], [3, np.nan, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(data)

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_imputed)

print("Original data:\n", data)
print("\nImputed data:\n", data_imputed)
print("\nScaled data:\n", data_scaled)
```

Slide 4: Feature Selection and Engineering

Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. These techniques can help reduce overfitting, improve model accuracy, and speed up training.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate a regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Perform feature selection
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_regression, k=5)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

print("Original number of features:", X.shape[1])
print("Number of features after selection:", X_selected.shape[1])

# Display selected feature indices
print("Selected feature indices:", selector.get_support(indices=True))
```

Slide 5: Supervised Learning: Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a discrete class label for each input instance. Common algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Let's implement a simple binary classification using Logistic Regression.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate a binary classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Classification accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 6: Supervised Learning: Regression

Regression is another supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Let's implement a simple linear regression model.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Generate a regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate performance metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean squared error: {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared score: {r2:.2f}")
```

Slide 7: Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together. It's used for discovering inherent patterns or structures in data without labeled responses. A popular clustering algorithm is K-means. Let's implement K-means clustering on a sample dataset.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a dataset with 3 clusters
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=3, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=42)

# Perform K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=cluster_labels, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], 
            marker='x', s=200, linewidths=3, color='r', label='Centroids')
plt.title('K-means Clustering')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its important characteristics. This can help with visualization, noise reduction, and speeding up learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common dimensionality reduction technique.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the digits dataset
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.data
y = digits.target

# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
scatter = plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(scatter)
plt.title('PCA of Digits Dataset')
plt.xlabel('First Principal Component')
plt.ylabel('Second Principal Component')
plt.show()

print(f"Explained variance ratio: {pca.explained_variance_ratio_}")
```

Slide 9: Model Evaluation and Validation

Model evaluation is crucial to assess how well a machine learning model performs. Common techniques include cross-validation, confusion matrices, and various performance metrics. Let's implement k-fold cross-validation and calculate some common metrics.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Generate a classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Create an SVM classifier
clf = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {cv_scores.mean():.2f}")

# Fit the model and make predictions
clf.fit(X, y)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

# Generate confusion matrix and classification report
cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)
cr = classification_report(y, y_pred)

print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(cm)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(cr)
```

Slide 10: Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm. This can significantly improve model performance. Common techniques include Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Let's implement Grid Search for tuning an SVM classifier.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate a classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear'],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto', 0.1, 1]
}

# Create an SVM classifier
svm = SVC(random_state=42)

# Perform Grid Search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X, y)

print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best cross-validation score:", grid_search.best_score_)
```

Slide 11: Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models to create a more robust and accurate model. Common techniques include Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Voting Classifiers. Let's implement a Random Forest classifier.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate a classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Random Forest classifier
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and calculate accuracy
y_pred = rf_clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Random Forest accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Feature importance
importances = rf_clf.feature_importances_
for i, importance in enumerate(importances):
    print(f"Feature {i}: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural Networks, especially Deep Learning models, have revolutionized machine learning in recent years. They're particularly effective for complex tasks like image and speech recognition. Let's implement a simple neural network using Keras for a classification task.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Generate a classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data and scale features
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a simple neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Image Classification

Image classification is a common application of machine learning, particularly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Let's build a simple CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

# Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Build the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, 
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
print(f'\nTest accuracy: {test_acc:.2f}')
```

Slide 14: Real-life Example: Text Classification

Text classification is another common application of machine learning, often used in sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. Let's build a simple text classifier using TensorFlow and Keras.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample data
texts = ['I love this product', 'This is terrible', 'Neutral opinion', 'Amazing experience', 'Worst purchase ever']
labels = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]  # 1: positive, 0: negative, 2: neutral

# Tokenize the texts
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token="<OOV>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)

# Pad sequences
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10, padding='post', truncating='post')

# Create and compile the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=16, input_length=10),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(padded, labels, epochs=50, verbose=0)

# Test the model
test_text = ["This is a great product"]
test_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_text)
test_padded = pad_sequences(test_seq, maxlen=10, padding='post', truncating='post')

predictions = model.predict(test_padded)
print(f"Prediction: {predictions}")
print(f"Predicted class: {tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1).numpy()[0]}")
```
