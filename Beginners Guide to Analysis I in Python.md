## Beginners Guide to Analysis I in Python:

Slide 1: Introduction to Analysis in Python

* Analysis refers to the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover patterns, insights, and trends. Python is a popular language for data analysis due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries.

Slide 2: Setting Up the Environment

* To get started with data analysis in Python, you need to install Python and set up the necessary libraries and tools.


```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Slide 3: Importing Libraries

* The first step in any Python analysis is to import the required libraries.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

Slide 4: Reading Data

* Python provides various ways to read data from different sources, such as CSV files, Excel sheets, databases, and more.


```python
# Read data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

Slide 5: Exploring Data

* Once you have loaded the data, you can explore it by examining its shape, data types, and summary statistics.


```python
# View the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Check the shape of the data
print(data.shape)

# Get summary statistics
print(data.describe())
```

Slide 6: Handling Missing Data

* Real-world datasets often contain missing values, which need to be handled appropriately.


```python
# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing values with mean
data['column'] = data['column'].fillna(data['column'].mean())
```

Slide 7: Data Cleaning

* Data cleaning involves handling outliers, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.


```python
# Remove duplicates
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Handle outliers
data = data[data['column'] < 3 * data['column'].std()]
```

Slide 8: Data Transformation

* Data transformation involves converting data into a more suitable format for analysis or modeling.


```python
# Convert data types
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])

# Create new features
data['age_group'] = pd.cut(data['age'], bins=[0, 18, 35, 65, 120], labels=['child', 'young', 'adult', 'senior'])
```

Slide 9: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* EDA involves visualizing and summarizing data to identify patterns, relationships, and potential issues.


```python
# Plot a histogram
plt.hist(data['column'], bins=20)
plt.show()

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(data['x'], data['y'])
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Statistical Analysis

* Python provides various statistical functions and libraries for performing hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and more.


```python
# Calculate correlation
print(data['column1'].corr(data['column2']))

# Perform a t-test
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print(f'p-value: {p_val}')
```

Slide 11: Machine Learning

* Python offers powerful machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for building and evaluating predictive models.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
