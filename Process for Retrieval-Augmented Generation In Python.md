## Process for Retrieval-Augmented Generation In Python

Slide 1: 

Data Collection

The first step in the RAG process involves gathering diverse data from various sources such as web scraping, APIs, and internal databases. This step ensures that the knowledge base contains a comprehensive and diverse set of information.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Web Scraping
url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
data = soup.find_all("div", {"class": "data-container"})

# API
api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = requests.get(api_url)
data = response.json()

# Internal Database
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM data_table")
data = cursor.fetchall()
conn.close()
```

Slide 2: 

Data Standardization

After collecting data from various sources, it is essential to convert it into a uniform format for interpretation. This process involves cleaning, formatting, and standardizing the data to ensure consistency and compatibility with the subsequent steps.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read data from different sources
data1 = pd.read_csv("data1.csv")
data2 = pd.read_json("data2.json")
data3 = pd.read_excel("data3.xlsx")

# Standardize data formats
data1 = data1.rename(columns={"col1": "column1", "col2": "column2"})
data2 = data2[["column1", "column2"]]
data3 = data3[["column1", "column2"]]

# Combine standardized data
combined_data = pd.concat([data1, data2, data3], ignore_index=True)
```

Slide 3: 

Chunking

To efficiently process large documents, the RAG process involves dividing the document into smaller, manageable chunks. This step ensures that the word embeddings and vector representations are computed efficiently and accurately.

```python
import nltk

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=100):
    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_length = 0

    for sentence in sentences:
        sentence_length = len(sentence.split())
        if current_length + sentence_length > chunk_size:
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sentence]
            current_length = sentence_length
        else:
            current_chunk.append(sentence)
            current_length += sentence_length

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

    return chunks
```

Slide 4: 

Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are numerical representations of words that capture their semantic and contextual meanings. In the RAG process, document chunks are transformed into word embeddings, allowing for efficient comparison and retrieval of relevant information.

```python
import gensim.downloader as api

# Load pre-trained word embeddings
word_vectors = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300")

def get_word_embeddings(text):
    embeddings = []
    words = text.split()
    for word in words:
        if word in word_vectors:
            embeddings.append(word_vectors[word])
    return embeddings
```

Slide 5: 

Vector Store

The vector store is a specialized data structure that stores numerical representations of document chunks, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information. In the RAG process, the numerical chunks (word embeddings) are stored in a vector store as the knowledge base.

```python
from rag import VectorStore

# Create a vector store
vector_store = VectorStore()

# Store numerical chunks in the vector store
for chunk in numerical_chunks:
    vector_store.add(chunk)
```

Slide 6: 

Query Processing

User queries are converted into numerical format using word embeddings, similar to the document chunks. This step allows for efficient comparison between the user query and the stored knowledge base during the retrieval process.

```python
def process_query(query):
    query_embeddings = get_word_embeddings(query)
    return query_embeddings
```

Slide 7: 

Retrieval

The retrieval step involves comparing the numerical representation of the user query with the stored numerical chunks in the vector store. The most relevant answer chunks are retrieved from the knowledge base based on their similarity to the query.

```python
from rag import VectorStore

def retrieve_answers(query_embeddings, vector_store):
    top_matches = vector_store.search(query_embeddings, top_k=5)
    return [match.text for match in top_matches]
```

Slide 8: 

Textual Conversion

The retrieved answer chunks, which are in numerical format, need to be converted back into textual format for human interpretation and consumption.

```python
def convert_to_text(numerical_chunks):
    texts = []
    for chunk in numerical_chunks:
        text = " ".join([word_vectors.most_similar(chunk)[0][0] for chunk in chunk])
        texts.append(text)
    return texts
```

Slide 9: 

LLM Input

The user query and the retrieved answer chunks are provided as input to large language models (LLMs) with a curated prompt. The LLMs use this information to generate a final, contextualized answer.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load LLM
qa_model = pipeline("question-answering")

# Generate answer
answer = qa_model(question=query, context=retrieved_answers)
```

Slide 10: 

Output

The final step in the RAG process is to display the correct answer generated by the LLMs, leveraging insights from both the user query and the retrieved information from the knowledge base.

```python
print(f"Query: {query}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

Slide 12: 

Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval systems to generate accurate and informative responses by integrating retrieved knowledge from a knowledge base.

The RAG process involves the following key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather diverse data from various sources.
2. Data Standardization: Convert collected data into a uniform format.
3. Chunking: Divide documents into smaller, manageable chunks.
4. Word Embeddings: Transform chunks into numerical representations.
5. Vector Store: Store numerical chunks in a vector store as the knowledge base.
6. Query Processing: Convert user queries into numerical format.
7. Retrieval: Retrieve relevant answer chunks from the knowledge base.
8. Textual Conversion: Convert retrieved answer chunks into textual format.
9. LLM Input: Provide user query and retrieved answers as input to LLMs.
10. Output: Display the final answer generated by LLMs.

RAG combines the power of retrieval systems to identify relevant information and the generative capabilities of LLMs to produce coherent and contextual responses, making it suitable for various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and summarization.

```python
# Example code snippet
import rag

# Initialize RAG components
data_collector = rag.DataCollector()
data_standardizer = rag.DataStandardizer()
chunker = rag.Chunker()
# ... (additional component initializations)

# Perform RAG process
data = data_collector.collect_data()
standardized_data = data_standardizer.standardize(data)
chunks = chunker.chunk_text(standardized_data)
# ... (additional component operations)
```
