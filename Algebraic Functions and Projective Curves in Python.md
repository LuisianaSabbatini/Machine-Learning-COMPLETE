## Algebraic Functions and Projective Curves in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Algebraic Functions and Projective Curves

Algebraic functions and projective curves are fundamental concepts in algebraic geometry, linking algebra and geometry. They provide powerful tools for understanding and solving complex mathematical problems. This presentation will explore these concepts, their properties, and applications using Python to illustrate key ideas.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_algebraic_curve(f, x_range, y_range):
    x = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], 1000)
    y = np.linspace(y_range[0], y_range[1], 1000)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = f(X, Y)
    plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[0], colors='b')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.title('Algebraic Curve')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

# Example: Plot the unit circle
plot_algebraic_curve(lambda x, y: x**2 + y**2 - 1, (-1.5, 1.5), (-1.5, 1.5))
```

Slide 2: Algebraic Functions

Algebraic functions are expressions involving variables and constants combined using algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation with rational exponents). They form the building blocks of algebraic geometry and are crucial in defining algebraic curves and surfaces.

```python
def algebraic_function(x, y):
    return x**3 + y**2 - 4*x + 2

# Evaluate the function at a point
x, y = 1, 2
result = algebraic_function(x, y)
print(f"f({x}, {y}) = {result}")

# Output: f(1, 2) = 1
```

Slide 3: Projective Curves

Projective curves are algebraic curves viewed in projective space rather than affine space. This perspective allows us to study curves "at infinity" and provides a more complete geometric picture. Projective curves are defined by homogeneous polynomials in projective coordinates.

```python
import sympy as sp

def projective_curve(x, y, z):
    return x**3 + y**3 + z**3 - 3*x*y*z

# Define symbolic variables
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')

# Create the projective curve equation
curve_eq = projective_curve(x, y, z)
print("Projective curve equation:")
sp.pprint(curve_eq)

# Output: Projective curve equation:
#    3    3    3
# x  + y  + z  - 3⋅x⋅y⋅z
```

Slide 4: Affine vs. Projective Curves

Affine curves are the familiar curves in 2D Cartesian coordinates, while projective curves extend to "points at infinity." Projective geometry allows us to handle singularities and intersections more elegantly. We can convert between affine and projective representations.

```python
def affine_to_projective(x, y):
    return [x, y, 1]

def projective_to_affine(x, y, z):
    if z == 0:
        return "Point at infinity"
    return [x/z, y/z]

# Example
affine_point = [2, 3]
proj_point = affine_to_projective(*affine_point)
print(f"Affine point {affine_point} to projective: {proj_point}")

proj_point = [4, 6, 2]
affine_point = projective_to_affine(*proj_point)
print(f"Projective point {proj_point} to affine: {affine_point}")

# Output:
# Affine point [2, 3] to projective: [2, 3, 1]
# Projective point [4, 6, 2] to affine: [2.0, 3.0]
```

Slide 5: Polynomial Representation

Algebraic curves are often represented by polynomials. In Python, we can work with polynomials using libraries like NumPy or SymPy. These tools allow us to perform operations like addition, multiplication, and evaluation of polynomials.

```python
import numpy as np

def polynomial_evaluate(coeffs, x):
    return np.polyval(coeffs, x)

# Define a polynomial: 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1
coeffs = [2, -3, 4, -1]

# Evaluate the polynomial at x = 2
x = 2
result = polynomial_evaluate(coeffs, x)
print(f"p({x}) = {result}")

# Plot the polynomial
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
y = polynomial_evaluate(coeffs, x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Polynomial Curve")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Output: p(2) = 13
```

Slide 6: Singular Points

Singular points are special points on algebraic curves where the curve intersects itself or has a cusp. These points are crucial in understanding the geometry of the curve. We can find singular points by solving a system of equations.

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_singular_points(f):
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    fx = sp.diff(f, x)
    fy = sp.diff(f, y)
    singular_points = sp.solve((f, fx, fy), (x, y))
    return singular_points

# Example: y^2 = x^3 - x
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
f = y**2 - (x**3 - x)
singular_points = find_singular_points(f)
print("Singular points:")
for point in singular_points:
    print(point)

# Output:
# Singular points:
# (0, 0)
# (1, 0)
# (-1, 0)
```

Slide 7: Intersection of Curves

Finding the intersection points of two algebraic curves is a fundamental problem in algebraic geometry. We can use symbolic computation to solve the system of equations representing the curves.

```python
import sympy as sp

def intersection_points(f, g):
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    return sp.solve((f, g), (x, y))

# Example: Intersect a circle and a parabola
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
circle = x**2 + y**2 - 1
parabola = y - x**2

intersections = intersection_points(circle, parabola)
print("Intersection points:")
for point in intersections:
    print(point)

# Output:
# Intersection points:
# (-sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)
# (sqrt(2)/2, 1/2)
```

Slide 8: Genus of Algebraic Curves

The genus is a topological invariant of algebraic curves, representing the number of "holes" in the curve when viewed as a surface. It's crucial for classifying curves and understanding their properties. For a smooth projective curve of degree d, the genus is given by (d-1)(d-2)/2.

```python
def genus(degree):
    return (degree - 1) * (degree - 2) // 2

# Calculate genus for curves of different degrees
for d in range(1, 6):
    g = genus(d)
    print(f"A smooth projective curve of degree {d} has genus {g}")

# Output:
# A smooth projective curve of degree 1 has genus 0
# A smooth projective curve of degree 2 has genus 0
# A smooth projective curve of degree 3 has genus 1
# A smooth projective curve of degree 4 has genus 3
# A smooth projective curve of degree 5 has genus 6
```

Slide 9: Bézout's Theorem

Bézout's Theorem is a fundamental result in algebraic geometry, stating that two projective plane curves of degrees m and n intersect in exactly m\*n points, counting multiplicity and complex points. This theorem helps us understand the behavior of algebraic curves.

```python
def bezout_intersection_count(degree1, degree2):
    return degree1 * degree2

# Example: Intersection of a cubic and a quartic curve
cubic_degree = 3
quartic_degree = 4

intersection_points = bezout_intersection_count(cubic_degree, quartic_degree)
print(f"A cubic curve and a quartic curve intersect in {intersection_points} points")

# Output:
# A cubic curve and a quartic curve intersect in 12 points
```

Slide 10: Rational Points on Curves

Rational points on algebraic curves are points with rational coordinates. They play a crucial role in number theory and cryptography. Finding rational points can be challenging, but for some curves, we can use parametrization techniques.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def rational_points_on_circle(limit):
    points = []
    for m in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for n in range(1, limit + 1):
            x = Fraction(2*m*n, m*m + n*n)
            y = Fraction(m*m - n*n, m*m + n*n)
            if abs(x) <= 1 and abs(y) <= 1:
                points.append((x, y))
    return points

# Find rational points on the unit circle
limit = 5
rational_points = rational_points_on_circle(limit)
print("Rational points on the unit circle:")
for point in rational_points[:5]:  # Print first 5 points
    print(f"({point[0]}, {point[1]})")

# Output:
# Rational points on the unit circle:
# (0, -1)
# (-3/5, -4/5)
# (-4/5, 3/5)
# (-1, 0)
# (-5/13, -12/13)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Elliptic Curves in Cryptography

Elliptic curves are special algebraic curves widely used in cryptography. They provide strong security with smaller key sizes compared to other cryptographic systems. Here's a simple implementation of point addition on an elliptic curve over a finite field.

```python
def point_addition(P, Q, p, a):
    if P == (0, 0):
        return Q
    if Q == (0, 0):
        return P
    if P[0] == Q[0] and P[1] != Q[1]:
        return (0, 0)
    if P != Q:
        m = ((Q[1] - P[1]) * pow(Q[0] - P[0], -1, p)) % p
    else:
        m = ((3 * P[0]**2 + a) * pow(2 * P[1], -1, p)) % p
    x = (m**2 - P[0] - Q[0]) % p
    y = (m * (P[0] - x) - P[1]) % p
    return (x, y)

# Example: Point addition on y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 over F_17
p = 17  # Field size
a = 2   # Curve parameter
P = (5, 1)
Q = (6, 3)
R = point_addition(P, Q, p, a)
print(f"P + Q = {R}")

# Output: P + Q = (10, 6)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Bézier Curves in Computer Graphics

Bézier curves, a type of algebraic curve, are extensively used in computer graphics and design software. They allow smooth curve representation with a small number of control points. Here's an implementation of cubic Bézier curves using Python.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def bezier_curve(P0, P1, P2, P3, num_points=100):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, num_points)
    curve = (1-t)**3 * P0[:, np.newaxis] + \
            3 * (1-t)**2 * t * P1[:, np.newaxis] + \
            3 * (1-t) * t**2 * P2[:, np.newaxis] + \
            t**3 * P3[:, np.newaxis]
    return curve

# Define control points
P0 = np.array([0, 0])
P1 = np.array([1, 2])
P2 = np.array([3, 3])
P3 = np.array([4, 1])

# Generate Bézier curve
curve = bezier_curve(P0, P1, P2, P3)

# Plot the curve and control points
plt.plot(curve[0], curve[1], 'b-')
plt.plot([P0[0], P1[0], P2[0], P3[0]], [P0[1], P1[1], P2[1], P3[1]], 'ro-')
plt.title("Cubic Bézier Curve")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
