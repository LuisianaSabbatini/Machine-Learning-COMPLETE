## Visualizing Galois Theory with Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Galois Theory

Galois Theory is a branch of abstract algebra that provides a connection between field theory and group theory. It was developed by Ã‰variste Galois in the 19th century to study the solutions of polynomial equations.

```python
def is_field(elements, add, multiply):
    # Check if the given set with operations forms a field
    return (
        is_abelian_group(elements, add) and
        is_abelian_group([e for e in elements if e != 0], multiply) and
        is_distributive(elements, add, multiply)
    )

def is_abelian_group(elements, operation):
    # Check if the given set with operation forms an abelian group
    return (
        is_closed(elements, operation) and
        is_associative(elements, operation) and
        has_identity(elements, operation) and
        has_inverse(elements, operation) and
        is_commutative(elements, operation)
    )

# Note: Implementations of other helper functions (is_closed, is_associative, etc.) are omitted for brevity
```

Slide 2: Field Extensions

A field extension is a larger field that contains a smaller field. In Galois Theory, we study how polynomials behave over different field extensions.

```python
class FieldExtension:
    def __init__(self, base_field, extension_element):
        self.base_field = base_field
        self.extension_element = extension_element
    
    def contains(self, element):
        # Check if the element is in the field extension
        return element in self.base_field or self.is_algebraic(element)
    
    def is_algebraic(self, element):
        # Check if the element is algebraic over the base field
        # This is a simplified implementation
        return any(self.base_field.contains(coeff) for coeff in element.coefficients())
    
    def degree(self):
        # Calculate the degree of the field extension
        return self.extension_element.minimal_polynomial().degree()
```

Slide 3: Galois Groups

The Galois group of a polynomial is the group of automorphisms of its splitting field that fix the base field. It captures the symmetries of the polynomial's roots.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, groebner

def galois_group(polynomial):
    # Compute the Galois group of a polynomial
    x = symbols('x')
    roots = Poly(polynomial, x).all_roots()
    
    def generate_permutations(roots):
        if len(roots) == 1:
            yield roots
        else:
            for i in range(len(roots)):
                for perm in generate_permutations(roots[:i] + roots[i+1:]):
                    yield [roots[i]] + perm
    
    permutations = list(generate_permutations(roots))
    
    # Check which permutations preserve the polynomial relations
    group = []
    for perm in permutations:
        if all(groebner([p.subs(dict(zip(roots, perm))) for p in polynomial.coeffs()]) == 
               groebner(polynomial.coeffs())):
            group.append(perm)
    
    return group
```

Slide 4: Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a correspondence between intermediate fields of a field extension and subgroups of its Galois group.

```python
class GaloisCorrespondence:
    def __init__(self, field_extension, galois_group):
        self.field_extension = field_extension
        self.galois_group = galois_group
        self.subgroups = self._compute_subgroups()
        self.intermediate_fields = self._compute_intermediate_fields()
    
    def _compute_subgroups(self):
        # Compute all subgroups of the Galois group
        # This is a simplified implementation
        return [self.galois_group]  # In reality, we'd compute all subgroups
    
    def _compute_intermediate_fields(self):
        # Compute all intermediate fields of the field extension
        # This is a simplified implementation
        return [self.field_extension.base_field, self.field_extension]
    
    def correspond(self, subgroup):
        # Find the corresponding intermediate field for a given subgroup
        index = self.subgroups.index(subgroup)
        return self.intermediate_fields[index]
```

Slide 5: Solvability by Radicals

Galois Theory provides a criterion for determining whether a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals, i.e., whether its roots can be expressed using arithmetic operations and nth roots.

```python
def is_solvable_by_radicals(polynomial):
    galois_group = galois_group(polynomial)
    return is_solvable_group(galois_group)

def is_solvable_group(group):
    if len(group) == 1:
        return True
    
    normal_subgroup = find_normal_subgroup(group)
    if normal_subgroup is None:
        return False
    
    quotient_group = create_quotient_group(group, normal_subgroup)
    return is_abelian(quotient_group) and is_solvable_group(normal_subgroup)

# Note: Implementations of helper functions (find_normal_subgroup, create_quotient_group, is_abelian) are omitted for brevity
```

Slide 6: Splitting Fields

A splitting field of a polynomial is the smallest field extension in which the polynomial splits into linear factors.

```python
from sympy import Poly, symbols, factor

def splitting_field(polynomial, base_field):
    x = symbols('x')
    poly = Poly(polynomial, x)
    
    # Factor the polynomial
    factors = factor(poly)
    
    # Collect all unique roots
    roots = set()
    for factor, _ in factors.args:
        if factor.is_linear:
            roots.add(-factor.coeff(x, 0) / factor.coeff(x, 1))
    
    # Create the splitting field by adjoining all roots to the base field
    splitting_field = base_field
    for root in roots:
        splitting_field = FieldExtension(splitting_field, root)
    
    return splitting_field
```

Slide 7: Fixed Fields

The fixed field of a group of automorphisms is the set of elements that are left unchanged by all automorphisms in the group.

```python
def fixed_field(field, automorphism_group):
    fixed_elements = set()
    
    for element in field:
        if all(automorphism(element) == element for automorphism in automorphism_group):
            fixed_elements.add(element)
    
    return FieldExtension(field.base_field, fixed_elements)
```

Slide 8: Normal Extensions

A field extension is normal if it is the splitting field of a separable polynomial. Normal extensions play a crucial role in Galois Theory.

```python
def is_normal_extension(extension):
    base_field = extension.base_field
    x = symbols('x')
    
    # Find a primitive element of the extension
    primitive_element = find_primitive_element(extension)
    
    # Compute the minimal polynomial of the primitive element
    min_poly = minimal_polynomial(primitive_element, base_field)
    
    # Check if the extension is the splitting field of its minimal polynomial
    return splitting_field(min_poly, base_field) == extension

def find_primitive_element(extension):
    # Implementation omitted for brevity
    pass

def minimal_polynomial(element, field):
    # Implementation omitted for brevity
    pass
```

Slide 9: Galois Correspondence in Action

Let's see how the Galois correspondence works for a specific polynomial.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, solve

def galois_correspondence_example():
    x = symbols('x')
    polynomial = x**4 - 2
    
    # Compute the Galois group
    G = galois_group(polynomial)
    
    # Compute the splitting field
    K = splitting_field(polynomial, FieldExtension(RationalField(), None))
    
    # Create the Galois correspondence
    correspondence = GaloisCorrespondence(K, G)
    
    # Example: Find the fixed field of a subgroup
    H = G[0:len(G)//2]  # Take a subgroup (this is a simplification)
    F = correspondence.correspond(H)
    
    return F

# Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, we would need to implement
# more sophisticated algorithms for computing Galois groups and handling field extensions.
```

Slide 10: Applications in Cryptography

Galois Theory has important applications in cryptography, particularly in the design and analysis of certain encryption algorithms.

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding

def rsa_example():
    # Generate RSA key pair
    private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
        public_exponent=65537,
        key_size=2048
    )
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    
    # Encrypt a message
    message = b"Galois Theory is fascinating!"
    ciphertext = public_key.encrypt(
        message,
        padding.OAEP(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            label=None
        )
    )
    
    # Decrypt the message
    plaintext = private_key.decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        padding.OAEP(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            label=None
        )
    )
    
    return plaintext == message

print(f"RSA encryption/decryption successful: {rsa_example()}")
```

Slide 11: Error-Correcting Codes

Galois Theory is fundamental in the construction of error-correcting codes, which are used to reliably transmit data over noisy channels.

```python
import numpy as np

class ReedSolomonCode:
    def __init__(self, n, k, field_size):
        self.n = n  # Code length
        self.k = k  # Message length
        self.field_size = field_size
        
    def encode(self, message):
        # Simplified Reed-Solomon encoding
        encoded = np.zeros(self.n, dtype=int)
        encoded[:self.k] = message
        for i in range(self.k, self.n):
            for j in range(self.k):
                encoded[i] = (encoded[i] + message[j] * pow(i+1, j, self.field_size)) % self.field_size
        return encoded
    
    def decode(self, received):
        # Note: Decoding Reed-Solomon codes is complex and involves solving systems of equations
        # This is a placeholder for the decoding process
        return received[:self.k]  # This is not actual decoding, just returning the first k symbols

# Example usage
rs_code = ReedSolomonCode(n=15, k=11, field_size=16)
message = np.random.randint(0, 16, 11)
encoded = rs_code.encode(message)
received = encoded.()
received[0] = (received[0] + 1) % 16  # Introduce an error
decoded = rs_code.decode(received)

print(f"Original message: {message}")
print(f"Encoded message: {encoded}")
print(f"Received message: {received}")
print(f"Decoded message: {decoded}")
```

Slide 12: Galois Theory in Quantum Computing

Galois Theory has applications in quantum computing, particularly in the design of quantum error-correcting codes and quantum algorithms.

```python
import numpy as np

def quantum_fourier_transform(n):
    """
    Generate the matrix for the Quantum Fourier Transform on n qubits.
    This is related to Galois Theory through the theory of cyclotomic fields.
    """
    omega = np.exp(2j * np.pi / (2**n))
    return np.array([[omega**(i*j) for j in range(2**n)] for i in range(2**n)]) / np.sqrt(2**n)

def apply_qft(state, n):
    """Apply the Quantum Fourier Transform to a quantum state."""
    qft_matrix = quantum_fourier_transform(n)
    return np.dot(qft_matrix, state)

# Example usage
n_qubits = 3
initial_state = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])  # |000âŸ© state
transformed_state = apply_qft(initial_state, n_qubits)

print("Initial state:", initial_state)
print("Transformed state:", transformed_state)
```

Slide 13: Galois Theory and Algebraic Number Theory

Galois Theory is closely connected to algebraic number theory, which studies the properties of algebraic numbers and their extensions.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, roots, ZZ

def cyclotomic_polynomial(n):
    """
    Compute the nth cyclotomic polynomial.
    Cyclotomic polynomials are important in both Galois Theory and algebraic number theory.
    """
    x = symbols('x')
    factors = [(x**d - 1)**ZZ(n).totient()//d.totient() for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0]
    return Poly.from_expr(factors[-1] // prod(factors[:-1]))

def is_cyclotomic(polynomial):
    """Check if a polynomial is cyclotomic."""
    x = symbols('x')
    poly = Poly(polynomial, x)
    if poly.is_monic() and poly.is_irreducible():
        root_of_unity = next(iter(roots(poly)))
        if abs(abs(root_of_unity) - 1) < 1e-10:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage
n = 5
cyclo_poly = cyclotomic_polynomial(n)
print(f"The {n}th cyclotomic polynomial is: {cyclo_poly}")
print(f"Is it cyclotomic? {is_cyclotomic(cyclo_poly)}")
```
