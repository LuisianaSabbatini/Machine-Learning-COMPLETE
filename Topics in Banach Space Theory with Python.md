## Topics in Banach Space Theory in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Banach Spaces

A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. In simpler terms, it's a vector space with a notion of distance that allows us to talk about convergence of sequences.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_complete(sequence):
    # Check if the sequence is Cauchy
    epsilon = 1e-10
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(sequence)):
            if np.linalg.norm(sequence[i] - sequence[j]) > epsilon:
                return False
    return True

# Example sequence in R^2
sequence = [np.array([1/n, 1/n]) for n in range(1, 1001)]

print(f"Is the sequence complete? {is_complete(sequence)}")
```

Slide 2: Normed Spaces

A normed space is a vector space equipped with a norm, which is a function that assigns a non-negative length or size to each vector in the space.

```python
import numpy as np

def euclidean_norm(vector):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(vector)))

def p_norm(vector, p):
    return np.power(np.sum(np.power(np.abs(vector), p)), 1/p)

v = np.array([3, 4])
print(f"Euclidean norm of {v}: {euclidean_norm(v)}")
print(f"1-norm of {v}: {p_norm(v, 1)}")
print(f"2-norm of {v}: {p_norm(v, 2)}")
print(f"âˆž-norm of {v}: {p_norm(v, np.inf)}")
```

Slide 3: Completeness

A normed space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point in the space. This property is crucial for many theorems in functional analysis.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_cauchy(sequence, epsilon=1e-10):
    for i in range(len(sequence)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(sequence)):
            if np.abs(sequence[i] - sequence[j]) > epsilon:
                return False
    return True

def limit_exists(sequence):
    return np.all(np.isfinite(sequence)) and np.all(~np.isnan(sequence))

# Example: sequence converging to e
sequence = [sum([1/np.math.factorial(k) for k in range(n)]) for n in range(1, 1001)]

print(f"Is the sequence Cauchy? {is_cauchy(sequence)}")
print(f"Does the limit exist? {limit_exists(sequence)}")
print(f"Limit of the sequence: {sequence[-1]}")
```

Slide 4: Linear Operators

Linear operators are functions between vector spaces that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. They are fundamental in the study of Banach spaces.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_linear_operator(operator, x, y, alpha, beta):
    return np.allclose(operator(alpha*x + beta*y), alpha*operator(x) + beta*operator(y))

# Example linear operator: rotation in R^2
def rotate(theta):
    def operator(v):
        rotation_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],
                                    [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]])
        return rotation_matrix @ v
    return operator

x = np.array([1, 0])
y = np.array([0, 1])
rotation_45 = rotate(np.pi/4)

print(f"Is rotation a linear operator? {is_linear_operator(rotation_45, x, y, 2, 3)}")
```

Slide 5: Bounded Linear Operators

A linear operator is bounded if it maps bounded sets to bounded sets. The set of all bounded linear operators between two normed spaces forms a normed space itself.

```python
import numpy as np

def operator_norm(A):
    return np.linalg.norm(A, ord=2)

def is_bounded(A, bound):
    return operator_norm(A) <= bound

# Example: matrix as a bounded linear operator
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
x = np.array([1, 1])

print(f"Operator norm of A: {operator_norm(A)}")
print(f"Is A bounded by 6? {is_bounded(A, 6)}")
print(f"A * x = {A @ x}")
```

Slide 6: Banach Fixed-Point Theorem

The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, also known as the Contraction Mapping Theorem, is a powerful tool for proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain equations.

```python
import numpy as np

def contraction_mapping(x):
    return np.cos(x) / 2

def fixed_point_iteration(f, x0, tolerance=1e-10, max_iterations=1000):
    x = x0
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        x_new = f(x)
        if np.abs(x_new - x) < tolerance:
            return x_new, i+1
        x = x_new
    return None, max_iterations

x0 = 0
fixed_point, iterations = fixed_point_iteration(contraction_mapping, x0)

print(f"Fixed point: {fixed_point}")
print(f"Iterations: {iterations}")
print(f"Verification: f(x) - x = {contraction_mapping(fixed_point) - fixed_point}")
```

Slide 7: Hahn-Banach Theorem

The Hahn-Banach Theorem is a fundamental result in functional analysis that allows the extension of bounded linear functionals from a subspace to the entire space.

```python
import numpy as np

def extend_functional(subspace_basis, functional_values, vector):
    # This is a simplified version for finite-dimensional spaces
    A = np.array(subspace_basis).T
    b = np.array(functional_values)
    
    # Solve the system A * x = b
    coeffs = np.linalg.lstsq(A, b, rcond=None)[0]
    
    # Extend the functional
    return np.dot(coeffs, vector)

# Example
subspace_basis = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]
functional_values = [1, 2]
vector = np.array([1, 1, 1])

extended_value = extend_functional(subspace_basis, functional_values, vector)
print(f"Extended functional value: {extended_value}")
```

Slide 8: Uniform Boundedness Principle

The Uniform Boundedness Principle, also known as the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem, states that a family of bounded linear operators that is pointwise bounded must be uniformly bounded.

```python
import numpy as np

def create_operator(n):
    return lambda x: n * np.sin(x/n)

def is_pointwise_bounded(operators, x_values, bound):
    return all(abs(op(x)) <= bound for op in operators for x in x_values)

def is_uniformly_bounded(operators, x_values, bound):
    return max(abs(op(x)) for op in operators for x in x_values) <= bound

operators = [create_operator(n) for n in range(1, 101)]
x_values = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)

print(f"Pointwise bounded: {is_pointwise_bounded(operators, x_values, 1)}")
print(f"Uniformly bounded: {is_uniformly_bounded(operators, x_values, 1)}")
```

Slide 9: Open Mapping Theorem

The Open Mapping Theorem states that a surjective continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is an open mapping, meaning it maps open sets to open sets.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_open_mapping(A):
    # For finite-dimensional spaces, this is equivalent to checking if A is invertible
    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) == A.shape[0]

# Example: rotation in R^2
theta = np.pi/4
A = np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],
              [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]])

print(f"Is the rotation matrix an open mapping? {is_open_mapping(A)}")

# Counter-example: projection onto x-axis
B = np.array([[1, 0],
              [0, 0]])

print(f"Is the projection matrix an open mapping? {is_open_mapping(B)}")
```

Slide 10: Closed Graph Theorem

The Closed Graph Theorem states that a linear operator between Banach spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_graph_closed(A, tolerance=1e-10):
    # For finite-dimensional spaces, this is equivalent to checking if A is bounded
    return np.linalg.norm(A, ord=2) < np.inf

# Example: bounded linear operator
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

print(f"Is the graph of A closed? {is_graph_closed(A)}")

# Counter-example: unbounded operator (not possible in finite dimensions)
def unbounded_operator(x):
    return x * np.exp(x)

# We can't directly apply is_graph_closed to unbounded_operator,
# but we know its graph is not closed
print("The graph of the unbounded operator is not closed.")
```

Slide 11: Dual Spaces

The dual space of a Banach space is the space of all continuous linear functionals on the space. It plays a crucial role in functional analysis.

```python
import numpy as np

def dual_norm(functional, primal_space):
    return max(abs(functional(x)) for x in primal_space)

# Example: dual of l^2 space
def l2_functional(x):
    return np.dot(x, [1/n for n in range(1, len(x)+1)])

primal_space = [np.random.randn(100) for _ in range(1000)]
normalized_primal_space = [x / np.linalg.norm(x) for x in primal_space]

print(f"Dual norm of the functional: {dual_norm(l2_functional, normalized_primal_space)}")
```

Slide 12: Weak Topology

The weak topology on a Banach space is the coarsest topology that makes all continuous linear functionals continuous. It's weaker than the norm topology but still very useful.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_weakly_convergent(sequence, functionals):
    limits = []
    for f in functionals:
        functional_values = [f(x) for x in sequence]
        if not np.all(np.isfinite(functional_values)):
            return False
        limits.append(np.mean(functional_values[-10:]))  # Approximate limit
    return np.all(np.isfinite(limits))

# Example sequence in R^2
sequence = [np.array([1/n, (-1)**n]) for n in range(1, 1001)]

# Example functionals
f1 = lambda x: x[0]
f2 = lambda x: x[1]

print(f"Is the sequence weakly convergent? {is_weakly_convergent(sequence, [f1, f2])}")
```

Slide 13: Reflexive Spaces

A Banach space is reflexive if it is isomorphic to its double dual. Reflexive spaces have many nice properties, including the weak compactness of closed bounded sets.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_reflexive(space, tolerance=1e-10):
    # This is a simplification. In general, checking reflexivity is more complex.
    # Here we're checking if the space is finite-dimensional, which implies reflexivity.
    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(space) == space.shape[1]

# Example: R^3 is reflexive
space = np.eye(3)
print(f"Is R^3 reflexive? {is_reflexive(space)}")

# Counter-example: l^1 is not reflexive
# We can't represent infinite-dimensional spaces directly,
# but we know l^1 is not reflexive
print("The space l^1 is not reflexive.")
```

Slide 14: Hilbert Spaces

Hilbert spaces are complete inner product spaces. They are a special class of Banach spaces with additional structure that makes them particularly useful in many applications.

```python
import numpy as np

def is_hilbert_space(vectors):
    # Check if the space has an inner product
    def inner_product(x, y):
        return np.dot(x, y)
    
    # Check if the space is complete (simplified for finite-dimensional case)
    def is_complete():
        return True  # Always true for finite-dimensional spaces
    
    # Check if the inner product satisfies the parallelogram law
    def satisfies_parallelogram_law(x, y):
        lhs = np.linalg.norm(x + y)**2 + np.linalg.norm(x - y)**2
        rhs = 2 * (np.linalg.norm(x)**2 + np.linalg.norm(y)**2)
        return np.isclose(lhs, rhs)

    return all(satisfies_parallelogram_law(x, y) for x in vectors for y in vectors) and is_complete()

# Example: R^3 with standard inner product
vectors = [np.array([1, 0, 0]), np.array([0, 1, 0]), np.array([0, 0, 1])]
print(f"Is R^3 a Hilbert space? {is_hilbert_space(vectors)}")
```
