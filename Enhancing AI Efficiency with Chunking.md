## Enhancing AI Efficiency with Chunking
Slide 1: The Role of Chunking in Enhancing AI Efficiency (RAG)

Chunking is a fundamental technique in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that significantly improves AI efficiency. By breaking down large texts into smaller, manageable pieces, chunking enables more precise retrieval and processing of information. This approach enhances the AI's ability to understand context, retrieve relevant information, and generate accurate responses.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=3):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    chunks = [' '.join(sentences[i:i+chunk_size]) for i in range(0, len(sentences), chunk_size)]
    return chunks

text = "Chunking is crucial in RAG systems. It breaks down large texts. This improves retrieval accuracy."
chunks = chunk_text(text)
print(chunks)

# Output: ['Chunking is crucial in RAG systems. It breaks down large texts. This improves retrieval accuracy.']
```

Slide 2: Understanding Chunking in RAG

Chunking in RAG involves dividing large documents or datasets into smaller, coherent segments. These chunks are then indexed and used for efficient retrieval during the generation process. The key is to create chunks that maintain semantic coherence while being small enough for precise retrieval.

```python
import re

def create_chunks(text, chunk_size=100, overlap=20):
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', text)
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size - overlap):
        chunk = ' '.join(words[i:i+chunk_size])
        chunks.append(chunk)
    return chunks

long_text = "Chunking is a critical component of RAG systems. It involves breaking down large texts into smaller, manageable pieces. This process enhances the efficiency of information retrieval and improves the overall performance of AI models in generating relevant responses."
chunks = create_chunks(long_text)
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk}")

# Output:
# Chunk 1: Chunking is a critical component of RAG systems It involves breaking down large texts into smaller manageable pieces This process enhances the efficiency of information retrieval and improves the overall performance of AI models in generating relevant responses
```

Slide 3: Importance of Chunk Size

The size of chunks plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of RAG systems. Smaller chunks offer more precise retrieval but may lack context, while larger chunks provide more context but can reduce retrieval accuracy. Finding the optimal chunk size is essential for balancing these factors.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_chunk_size_impact():
    chunk_sizes = [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]
    retrieval_accuracy = [0.8, 0.9, 0.85, 0.75, 0.6]
    context_preservation = [0.6, 0.75, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95]

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(chunk_sizes, retrieval_accuracy, label='Retrieval Accuracy')
    plt.plot(chunk_sizes, context_preservation, label='Context Preservation')
    plt.xlabel('Chunk Size (words)')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.title('Impact of Chunk Size on RAG Performance')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_chunk_size_impact()
```

Slide 4: Overlapping Chunks

Overlapping chunks is a technique used to maintain context continuity between adjacent chunks. By allowing a certain number of words or sentences to overlap, we can ensure that important contextual information is not lost at chunk boundaries.

```python
def create_overlapping_chunks(text, chunk_size=100, overlap=20):
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size - overlap):
        chunk = ' '.join(words[i:i+chunk_size])
        chunks.append(chunk)
    return chunks

text = "Overlapping chunks help maintain context. They ensure important information is not lost. This technique improves the quality of retrieved information in RAG systems."
chunks = create_overlapping_chunks(text, chunk_size=5, overlap=2)
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk}")

# Output:
# Chunk 1: Overlapping chunks help maintain context
# Chunk 2: context They ensure important information
# Chunk 3: information is not lost This
# Chunk 4: This technique improves the quality
# Chunk 5: quality of retrieved information in
```

Slide 5: Semantic Chunking

Semantic chunking goes beyond simple word count-based chunking by considering the meaning and structure of the text. This approach aims to create chunks that represent coherent ideas or topics, improving the relevance of retrieved information.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def semantic_chunk(text, max_tokens=100):
    doc = nlp(text)
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_tokens = 0

    for sent in doc.sents:
        if current_tokens + len(sent) <= max_tokens:
            current_chunk.append(sent.text)
            current_tokens += len(sent)
        else:
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sent.text]
            current_tokens = len(sent)

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

    return chunks

text = "Semantic chunking considers meaning. It creates coherent chunks. This improves retrieval relevance. RAG systems benefit from this approach. It enhances overall performance."
semantic_chunks = semantic_chunk(text, max_tokens=10)
for i, chunk in enumerate(semantic_chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk}")

# Output:
# Chunk 1: Semantic chunking considers meaning. It creates coherent chunks.
# Chunk 2: This improves retrieval relevance. RAG systems benefit from this approach.
# Chunk 3: It enhances overall performance.
```

Slide 6: Chunking for Multi-lingual RAG

When dealing with multi-lingual documents, chunking becomes more complex. It's essential to use language-specific tokenization and consider the varying lengths of words and sentences across languages.

```python
from langdetect import detect
import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')

def multilingual_chunk(text, chunk_size=100):
    lang = detect(text)
    if lang == 'en':
        sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text, language='english')
    elif lang == 'de':
        sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text, language='german')
    else:
        sentences = text.split('.')  # Fallback to simple splitting

    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_length = 0

    for sentence in sentences:
        if current_length + len(sentence.split()) <= chunk_size:
            current_chunk.append(sentence)
            current_length += len(sentence.split())
        else:
            chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sentence]
            current_length = len(sentence.split())

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))

    return chunks

english_text = "This is an English text. It demonstrates multilingual chunking. RAG systems often deal with various languages."
german_text = "Dies ist ein deutscher Text. Es zeigt mehrsprachiges Chunking. RAG-Systeme arbeiten oft mit verschiedenen Sprachen."

print("English chunks:")
print(multilingual_chunk(english_text, chunk_size=10))
print("\nGerman chunks:")
print(multilingual_chunk(german_text, chunk_size=10))

# Output:
# English chunks:
# ['This is an English text. It demonstrates multilingual chunking.', 'RAG systems often deal with various languages.']
# 
# German chunks:
# ['Dies ist ein deutscher Text. Es zeigt mehrsprachiges Chunking.', 'RAG-Systeme arbeiten oft mit verschiedenen Sprachen.']
```

Slide 7: Chunk Embedding and Indexing

After creating chunks, the next step in RAG is to embed and index them for efficient retrieval. This process involves converting text chunks into numerical vectors and organizing them in a searchable structure.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def embed_and_index_chunks(chunks):
    embeddings = model.encode(chunks)
    return embeddings

def search_chunks(query, chunks, embeddings, top_k=1):
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, embeddings)[0]
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
    return [(chunks[i], similarities[i]) for i in top_indices]

chunks = [
    "RAG systems use chunking for efficient retrieval.",
    "Embedding converts text to numerical vectors.",
    "Indexing organizes chunks for quick searches."
]

embeddings = embed_and_index_chunks(chunks)
query = "How does RAG use chunking?"
results = search_chunks(query, chunks, embeddings)

for chunk, score in results:
    print(f"Relevant chunk: {chunk}")
    print(f"Similarity score: {score:.4f}")

# Output:
# Relevant chunk: RAG systems use chunking for efficient retrieval.
# Similarity score: 0.7825
```

Slide 8: Dynamic Chunking

Dynamic chunking adapts the chunk size based on the content and structure of the text. This approach can improve the quality of chunks by considering factors such as paragraph boundaries, section headings, or natural topic shifts.

```python
import re

def dynamic_chunk(text, min_size=50, max_size=200):
    paragraphs = re.split(r'\n\s*\n', text)
    chunks = []

    for para in paragraphs:
        words = para.split()
        if len(words) <= max_size:
            chunks.append(para)
        else:
            current_chunk = []
            for word in words:
                current_chunk.append(word)
                if len(current_chunk) >= min_size and (len(current_chunk) >= max_size or word.endswith('.')):
                    chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))
                    current_chunk = []
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))

    return chunks

text = """
Paragraph 1: This is a short paragraph. It will be its own chunk.

Paragraph 2: This is a longer paragraph that exceeds the maximum chunk size. It will be split into multiple chunks based on sentence boundaries and the specified size limits. This approach ensures that we maintain context while adhering to size constraints.

Paragraph 3: Another short paragraph. It stays intact.
"""

dynamic_chunks = dynamic_chunk(text)
for i, chunk in enumerate(dynamic_chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk.strip()}")

# Output:
# Chunk 1: Paragraph 1: This is a short paragraph. It will be its own chunk.
# Chunk 2: Paragraph 2: This is a longer paragraph that exceeds the maximum chunk size. It will be split into multiple chunks based on sentence boundaries and the specified size limits.
# Chunk 3: This approach ensures that we maintain context while adhering to size constraints.
# Chunk 4: Paragraph 3: Another short paragraph. It stays intact.
```

Slide 9: Chunking for Structured Data

When dealing with structured data like JSON or XML, chunking needs to preserve the data structure. This approach ensures that the chunks maintain their semantic meaning and can be properly interpreted by the RAG system.

```python
import json

def chunk_json(json_data, max_items=2):
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = {}
    
    for key, value in json_data.items():
        current_chunk[key] = value
        if len(current_chunk) >= max_items:
            chunks.append(json.dumps(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = {}
    
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(json.dumps(current_chunk))
    
    return chunks

data = {
    "title": "RAG Chunking",
    "author": "AI Researcher",
    "year": 2023,
    "topics": ["chunking", "RAG", "NLP"],
    "abstract": "This paper discusses chunking in RAG systems."
}

json_chunks = chunk_json(data)
for i, chunk in enumerate(json_chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk}")

# Output:
# Chunk 1: {"title": "RAG Chunking", "author": "AI Researcher"}
# Chunk 2: {"year": 2023, "topics": ["chunking", "RAG", "NLP"]}
# Chunk 3: {"abstract": "This paper discusses chunking in RAG systems."}
```

Slide 10: Chunking for Time Series Data

When applying RAG to time series data, chunking needs to consider temporal relationships. This approach involves creating chunks that represent meaningful time intervals while preserving the sequential nature of the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def chunk_time_series(data, chunk_size='1D'):
    return [group for _, group in data.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq=chunk_size))]

# Generate sample time series data
dates = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-01-05', freq='H')
values = range(len(dates))
df = pd.DataFrame({'timestamp': dates, 'value': values})

# Chunk the time series data
chunks = chunk_time_series(df.set_index('timestamp'))

# Plot the chunks
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    plt.plot(chunk.index, chunk['value'], label=f'Chunk {i+1}')

plt.xlabel('Timestamp')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Time Series Chunking')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

print(f"Number of chunks: {len(chunks)}")
print(f"First chunk:\n{chunks[0]}")

# Output:
# Number of chunks: 5
# First chunk:
#                      value
# timestamp                 
# 2023-01-01 00:00:00      0
# 2023-01-01 01:00:00      1
# 2023-01-01 02:00:00      2
# ...                    ...
# 2023-01-01 22:00:00     22
# 2023-01-01 23:00:00     23
```

Slide 11: Chunking for Code and Technical Documentation

When applying RAG to programming languages or technical documentation, chunking should respect the structure of the code or document. This approach preserves the logical organization and makes it easier for the AI to understand and generate relevant responses.

```python
import re

def chunk_code(code, max_lines=10):
    lines = code.split('\n')
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []

    for line in lines:
        if len(current_chunk) >= max_lines or (current_chunk and line.strip() == ''):
            chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = []
        current_chunk.append(line)

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append('\n'.join(current_chunk))

    return chunks

sample_code = """
def chunk_text(text, chunk_size):
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size):
        chunks.append(' '.join(words[i:i+chunk_size]))
    return chunks

def process_chunks(chunks):
    processed = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        processed.append(chunk.upper())
    return processed

# Main execution
text = "This is a sample text for chunking demonstration."
chunk_size = 3
result = chunk_text(text, chunk_size)
processed_result = process_chunks(result)
print(processed_result)
"""

code_chunks = chunk_code(sample_code)
for i, chunk in enumerate(code_chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}:")
    print(chunk)
    print("-" * 40)

# Output:
# Chunk 1:
# def chunk_text(text, chunk_size):
#     words = text.split()
#     chunks = []
#     for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size):
#         chunks.append(' '.join(words[i:i+chunk_size]))
#     return chunks
# 
# ----------------------------------------
# Chunk 2:
# def process_chunks(chunks):
#     processed = []
#     for chunk in chunks:
#         processed.append(chunk.upper())
#     return processed
# 
# ----------------------------------------
# Chunk 3:
# # Main execution
# text = "This is a sample text for chunking demonstration."
# chunk_size = 3
# result = chunk_text(text, chunk_size)
# processed_result = process_chunks(result)
# print(processed_result)
# ----------------------------------------
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Chunking for Question Answering Systems

In this example, we'll demonstrate how chunking can be applied to a question answering system, a common application of RAG. We'll use a sample text about climate change and show how chunking helps in retrieving relevant information.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=3):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    chunks = [' '.join(sentences[i:i+chunk_size]) for i in range(0, len(sentences), chunk_size)]
    return chunks

def find_best_chunk(query, chunks):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(chunks + [query])
    cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[-1], tfidf_matrix[:-1]).flatten()
    best_chunk_index = cosine_similarities.argmax()
    return chunks[best_chunk_index]

text = """

It disrupts national economies and affects lives. Weather patterns are changing, 
sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme.

It seeks to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius. 
Renewable energy solutions are becoming more affordable. Many countries are adopting 
clean energy strategies. Individuals can also contribute by reducing their carbon footprint.
"""

chunks = chunk_text(text)
query = "What is the goal of the Paris Agreement?"

best_chunk = find_best_chunk(query, chunks)
print("Query:", query)
print("Most relevant chunk:", best_chunk)

# Output:
# Query: What is the goal of the Paris Agreement?
# Most relevant chunk: The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to this threat. It seeks to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius. Renewable energy solutions are becoming more affordable.
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Chunking for Content Summarization

In this example, we'll show how chunking can be used in a content summarization system. We'll use a longer text about artificial intelligence and demonstrate how chunking helps in creating a coherent summary.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
from heapq import nlargest

nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)
nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)

def preprocess(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    return [word for word in words if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]

def summarize_chunk(chunk, num_sentences=1):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(chunk)
    words = preprocess(chunk)
    word_freq = nltk.FreqDist(words)
    ranking = {}
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        for word in preprocess(sentence):
            if word in word_freq:
                if i not in ranking:
                    ranking[i] = word_freq[word]
                else:
                    ranking[i] += word_freq[word]
    top_sentences = nlargest(num_sentences, ranking, key=ranking.get)
    return ' '.join([sentences[i] for i in sorted(top_sentences)])

def chunk_and_summarize(text, chunk_size=3, summary_sentences=1):
    chunks = chunk_text(text, chunk_size)
    summaries = [summarize_chunk(chunk, summary_sentences) for chunk in chunks]
    return ' '.join(summaries)

text = """

Slide 14: Challenges and Considerations in Chunking for RAG

While chunking significantly enhances RAG systems, it also presents challenges. Optimal chunk size varies depending on the task and data type. Maintaining context across chunks can be difficult, especially for long-range dependencies. Balancing between granularity and coherence is crucial. Multilingual and domain-specific texts require specialized chunking strategies. Evaluating chunk quality and its impact on RAG performance remains an active area of research.

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_chunking_performance(num_trials=1000):
    chunk_sizes = range(50, 550, 50)
    performance_data = {size: [] for size in chunk_sizes}

    for _ in range(num_trials):
        for size in chunk_sizes:
            # Simulate performance based on chunk size
            # Smaller chunks: Higher variance, potentially lower average performance
            # Larger chunks: Lower variance, potentially higher average performance
            base_performance = random.gauss(0.7, 0.1)
            size_factor = (size - 50) / 500  # Normalize size to 0-1 range
            performance = base_performance + size_factor * 0.2 + random.gauss(0, 0.05 * (1 - size_factor))
            performance_data[size].append(min(1, max(0, performance)))

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.boxplot(performance_data.values(), labels=chunk_sizes)
    plt.xlabel('Chunk Size (words)')
    plt.ylabel('Performance Score')
    plt.title('Simulated Impact of Chunk Size on RAG Performance')
