## Training Custom Tokenizers with Hugging Face Transformers in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. It is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as it prepares the input text for further processing. Tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the tokenization strategy.

Slide 2: Why Use a Custom Tokenizer?

Pre-trained tokenizers are often designed for general-purpose tasks and may not work optimally for specific domains or languages. By training a custom tokenizer, you can tailor it to your specific task and data, potentially improving the performance of your NLP model.

Slide 3: Setting up the Environment

Code:

```python
!pip install transformers
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
```

First, we need to install the Hugging Face Transformers library and import the necessary modules. The `AutoTokenizer` class allows us to load and use pre-trained tokenizers easily.

Slide 4: Loading a Pre-trained Tokenizer

Code:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

To train a custom tokenizer, we start with a pre-trained tokenizer as a base. Here, we load the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, which is a popular choice for English text.

Slide 5: Preparing the Training Data

Code:

```python
with open('training_data.txt', 'r') as f:
    training_data = f.read().split('\n')
```

Prepare your training data by loading it from a text file. The training data should consist of text samples relevant to your domain or task.

Slide 6: Training the Tokenizer

Code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(training_data, vocab_size=52000)
```

We create a new tokenizer instance using the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) model and train it on the prepared training data. The `vocab_size` parameter specifies the desired size of the tokenizer's vocabulary.

Slide 7: Saving the Custom Tokenizer

Code:

```python
tokenizer.save('custom_tokenizer.json')
```

After training, we can save the custom tokenizer to a file for future use.

Slide 8: Loading the Custom Tokenizer

Code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer

tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file('custom_tokenizer.json')
```

To use the custom tokenizer, we can load it from the saved file.

Slide 9: Tokenizing Text

Code:

```python
text = "This is a sample text."
encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(encoded.tokens)
```

Now, we can use the custom tokenizer to tokenize text by calling the `encode` method. This will return an `Encoding` object containing the tokenized text.

Slide 10: Decoding Tokens

Code:

```python
decoded = tokenizer.decode(encoded.ids)
print(decoded)
```

The `decode` method of the tokenizer allows us to convert the token IDs back into their corresponding text representation.

Slide 11: Using the Custom Tokenizer with Transformers

Code:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))
```

To use the custom tokenizer with a pre-trained Transformer model, we need to resize the token embeddings of the model to match the size of our custom tokenizer's vocabulary.

Slide 12: Putting It All Together

Code:

```python
# Load the custom tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('custom_tokenizer')

# Load the pre-trained model and resize the token embeddings
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))

# Tokenize and encode text
text = "This is a custom tokenized text."
encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)

# Pass the encoded text to the model
output = model(**encoded)
```

This slide demonstrates the complete workflow of loading the custom tokenizer, resizing the token embeddings of the pre-trained model, tokenizing and encoding text using the custom tokenizer, and passing the encoded text to the model for further processing.
