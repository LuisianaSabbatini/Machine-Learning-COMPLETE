## Principal Orthogonal Latent Components Analysis Network (POLCA Net)
Slide 1: Introduction to POLCA Net

Principal Orthogonal Latent Components Analysis Network (POLCA Net) is an innovative approach that aims to extend the capabilities of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to non-linear domains. By combining an autoencoder framework with specialized loss functions, POLCA Net achieves effective dimensionality reduction, orthogonality, variance-based feature sorting, and high-fidelity reconstructions. When used with classification labels, it also provides a latent representation well-suited for linear classifiers and low-dimensional visualization of class distribution.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class POLCANet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim, num_classes):
        super(POLCANet, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, latent_dim)
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, input_dim)
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(latent_dim, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        latent = self.encoder(x)
        reconstructed = self.decoder(latent)
        class_pred = self.classifier(latent)
        return latent, reconstructed, class_pred
```

Slide 2: Autoencoder Framework

The POLCA Net architecture is built upon an autoencoder framework. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to compress input data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and then reconstruct the original data from this representation (decoding). This framework allows POLCA Net to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction while maintaining the ability to reconstruct the original data.

```python
class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim):
        super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, latent_dim)
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, input_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        latent = self.encoder(x)
        reconstructed = self.decoder(latent)
        return latent, reconstructed

# Example usage
input_dim = 100
latent_dim = 10
autoencoder = Autoencoder(input_dim, latent_dim)

# Generate random input data
x = torch.randn(32, input_dim)

# Forward pass
latent, reconstructed = autoencoder(x)

print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}")
print(f"Latent shape: {latent.shape}")
print(f"Reconstructed shape: {reconstructed.shape}")
```

Slide 3: Results for: Autoencoder Framework

```
Input shape: torch.Size([32, 100])
Latent shape: torch.Size([32, 10])
Reconstructed shape: torch.Size([32, 100])
```

Slide 4: Specialized Loss Functions

POLCA Net incorporates specialized loss functions to achieve its unique properties. These loss functions include reconstruction loss, orthogonality loss, variance-based sorting loss, and classification loss (when applicable). The combination of these losses allows POLCA Net to learn a latent representation that preserves important properties of PCA and LDA while extending to non-linear domains.

```python
def polca_loss(x, latent, reconstructed, class_pred, labels):
    # Reconstruction loss
    mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()
    recon_loss = mse_loss(reconstructed, x)

    # Orthogonality loss
    latent_T = torch.transpose(latent, 0, 1)
    orthogonality_loss = torch.norm(torch.matmul(latent_T, latent) - torch.eye(latent.shape[1]))

    # Variance-based sorting loss
    var_loss = -torch.sum(torch.var(latent, dim=0))

    # Classification loss (if applicable)
    if labels is not None:
        ce_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        class_loss = ce_loss(class_pred, labels)
    else:
        class_loss = 0

    # Combine losses
    total_loss = recon_loss + orthogonality_loss + var_loss + class_loss

    return total_loss
```

Slide 5: Reconstruction Loss

The reconstruction loss is a fundamental component of the POLCA Net loss function. It measures how well the autoencoder can reconstruct the original input data from the latent representation. By minimizing this loss, we ensure that the latent space captures essential information from the input data.

```python
def reconstruction_loss(x, reconstructed):
    mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()
    return mse_loss(reconstructed, x)

# Example usage
x = torch.randn(32, 100)  # Original input
reconstructed = torch.randn(32, 100)  # Reconstructed output

recon_loss = reconstruction_loss(x, reconstructed)
print(f"Reconstruction loss: {recon_loss.item()}")
```

Slide 6: Orthogonality Loss

The orthogonality loss enforces orthogonality between the latent components. This property is inspired by PCA, where principal components are orthogonal to each other. By minimizing this loss, POLCA Net learns a latent representation with uncorrelated features, similar to PCA but in a non-linear space.

```python
def orthogonality_loss(latent):
    latent_T = torch.transpose(latent, 0, 1)
    identity = torch.eye(latent.shape[1])
    return torch.norm(torch.matmul(latent_T, latent) - identity)

# Example usage
latent = torch.randn(32, 10)  # Latent representation

ortho_loss = orthogonality_loss(latent)
print(f"Orthogonality loss: {ortho_loss.item()}")
```

Slide 7: Variance-based Sorting Loss

The variance-based sorting loss encourages the latent components to be sorted by their variance, similar to how principal components in PCA are sorted by explained variance. This loss function helps POLCA Net learn a latent representation where the most important features (those with the highest variance) are placed first.

```python
def variance_sorting_loss(latent):
    return -torch.sum(torch.var(latent, dim=0))

# Example usage
latent = torch.randn(32, 10)  # Latent representation

var_loss = variance_sorting_loss(latent)
print(f"Variance-based sorting loss: {var_loss.item()}")
```

Slide 8: Classification Loss

When POLCA Net is used for classification tasks, a classification loss is added to the overall loss function. This loss ensures that the learned latent representation is not only good for reconstruction but also suitable for classification tasks. It encourages the latent space to separate different classes effectively.

```python
def classification_loss(class_pred, labels):
    ce_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    return ce_loss(class_pred, labels)

# Example usage
class_pred = torch.randn(32, 5)  # Predicted class scores
labels = torch.randint(0, 5, (32,))  # True labels

class_loss = classification_loss(class_pred, labels)
print(f"Classification loss: {class_loss.item()}")
```

Slide 9: Training POLCA Net

Training POLCA Net involves optimizing the network parameters to minimize the combined loss function. This process allows the network to learn a latent representation that satisfies the desired properties: effective dimensionality reduction, orthogonality, variance-based feature sorting, high-fidelity reconstructions, and good classification performance (when applicable).

```python
def train_polca_net(model, dataloader, num_epochs, learning_rate):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        for batch_x, batch_labels in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            latent, reconstructed, class_pred = model(batch_x)
            loss = polca_loss(batch_x, latent, reconstructed, class_pred, batch_labels)
            
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {total_loss/len(dataloader)}")

# Example usage (assumes 'model' and 'dataloader' are defined)
num_epochs = 10
learning_rate = 0.001

train_polca_net(model, dataloader, num_epochs, learning_rate)
```

Slide 10: Dimensionality Reduction with POLCA Net

One of the primary applications of POLCA Net is dimensionality reduction. By encoding high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space, POLCA Net can effectively compress the data while preserving important features and relationships. This can be particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D spaces.

```python
def reduce_dimensionality(model, data, target_dim=2):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        latent, _, _ = model(data)
    
    # Select the first 'target_dim' components
    reduced_data = latent[:, :target_dim]
    return reduced_data

# Example usage
input_dim = 100
latent_dim = 10
num_classes = 5
model = POLCANet(input_dim, latent_dim, num_classes)

# Generate random high-dimensional data
data = torch.randn(1000, input_dim)

# Reduce dimensionality to 2D
reduced_data = reduce_dimensionality(model, data, target_dim=2)

print(f"Original data shape: {data.shape}")
print(f"Reduced data shape: {reduced_data.shape}")
```

Slide 11: Results for: Dimensionality Reduction with POLCA Net

```
Original data shape: torch.Size([1000, 100])
Reduced data shape: torch.Size([1000, 2])
```

Slide 12: Visualization of Latent Space

Visualizing the latent space learned by POLCA Net can provide insights into the structure of the data and the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction. For classification tasks, this visualization can show how well the model separates different classes in the latent space.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_latent_space(latent, labels=None):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    if labels is None:
        plt.scatter(latent[:, 0], latent[:, 1])
    else:
        plt.scatter(latent[:, 0], latent[:, 1], c=labels, cmap='viridis')
    plt.xlabel('Latent Dimension 1')
    plt.ylabel('Latent Dimension 2')
    plt.title('POLCA Net Latent Space Visualization')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

# Example usage (assumes 'model' is trained and 'data' is available)
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    latent, _, _ = model(data)

# Generate random labels for demonstration
labels = torch.randint(0, 5, (1000,))

visualize_latent_space(latent[:, :2], labels)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Image Compression

POLCA Net can be used for image compression by learning a compact representation of image data. This example demonstrates how POLCA Net can be applied to compress and reconstruct images, potentially reducing storage requirements while maintaining image quality.

```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load MNIST dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
mnist = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)

# Train POLCA Net on MNIST (assuming model is already defined and trained)

# Select an image for compression
original_image = mnist[0][0].squeeze()

# Compress and reconstruct the image
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    latent, reconstructed, _ = model(original_image.unsqueeze(0))

# Visualize original and reconstructed images
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(original_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original Image')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(reconstructed.squeeze(), cmap='gray')
plt.title('Reconstructed Image')
plt.show()

print(f"Original image shape: {original_image.shape}")
print(f"Latent representation shape: {latent.shape}")
print(f"Reconstructed image shape: {reconstructed.shape}")
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Anomaly Detection

POLCA Net can be utilized for anomaly detection in various domains, such as manufacturing quality control or network intrusion detection. By learning the normal patterns in the data, POLCA Net can identify instances that deviate significantly from these patterns, potentially indicating anomalies or outliers.

```python
import numpy as np

def detect_anomalies(model, data, threshold):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        _, reconstructed, _ = model(data)
    
    # Calculate reconstruction error
    mse_loss = nn.MSELoss(reduction='none')
    reconstruction_errors = mse_loss(reconstructed, data).mean(dim=1)
    
    # Identify anomalies based on reconstruction error
    anomalies = reconstruction_errors > threshold
    return anomalies, reconstruction_errors

# Generate normal and anomalous data
normal_data = torch.randn(1000, 100)
anomalous_data = torch.randn(50, 100) * 2 + 5  # Shifted and scaled
all_data = torch.cat([normal_data, anomalous_data], dim=0)

# Detect anomalies
threshold = 0.1  # Set based on the distribution of reconstruction errors
anomalies, errors = detect_anomalies(model, all_data, threshold)

print(f"Number of detected anomalies: {anomalies.sum().item()}")
print(f"Mean reconstruction error for normal data: {errors[:1000].mean().item():.4f}")
print(f"Mean reconstruction error for anomalous data: {errors[1000:].mean().item():.4f}")
```
