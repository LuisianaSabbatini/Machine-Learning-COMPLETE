## Introduction to Regular Expressions in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Regular Expressions Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. They are used to perform pattern matching and text manipulation operations on strings. Example:

```python
import re

text = "Hello, World!"
pattern = r"Hello"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>
```

Slide 2: Importing the re Module To use regular expressions in Python, you need to import the re module, which provides a set of functions and methods for working with regular expressions. Example:

```python
import re
```

Slide 3: Basic Patterns Regular expressions use special characters and sequences to define patterns. Some basic patterns include literal characters, character classes, and quantifiers. Example:

```python
import re

# Literal characters
pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello, world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='hello'>
```

Slide 4: Character Classes Character classes define a set of characters that can match a single position in the pattern. They are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Example:

```python
import re

# Character class
pattern = r"[aeiou]"
text = "hello, world"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['e', 'o', 'o']
```

Slide 5: Quantifiers Quantifiers specify how many times a pattern should repeat in the input string. Common quantifiers include `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), and `{m,n}` (between m and n repetitions). Example:

```python
import re

# Quantifier
pattern = r"a*"
text = "aaaabbbb"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.group())  # Output: "aaaa"
```

Slide 6: Anchors Anchors specify the position of the pattern in the input string. The `^` anchor matches the start of the string, and the `$` anchor matches the end of the string. Example:

```python
import re

# Anchor
pattern = r"^hello"
text = "hello, world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='hello'>
```

Slide 7: Groups Groups are used to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are enclosed in parentheses `()`. Groups can be referenced using backreferences. Example:

```python
import re

# Group
pattern = r"(hello) \1"
text = "hello hello"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.group())  # Output: "hello hello"
```

Slide 8: Alternation The `|` operator allows you to match one pattern or another. It acts as an "or" condition. Example:

```python
import re

# Alternation
pattern = r"hello|world"
text = "hello, world"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['hello', 'world']
```

Slide 9: Escape Sequences Escape sequences are used to match special characters that have a meaning in regular expressions. The backslash `\` is used as an escape character. Example:

```python
import re

# Escape sequence
pattern = r"\."
text = "hello.world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.group())  # Output: "."
```

Slide 10: Flags Flags modify the behavior of regular expressions. Some common flags include `re.IGNORECASE` (case-insensitive matching), `re.MULTILINE` (treat strings as multiple lines), and `re.DOTALL` (make `.` match newlines). Example:

```python
import re

# Flag
pattern = r"hello"
text = "HELLO, world"
match = re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
print(match)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='HELLO'>
```

Slide 11: Substitution Regular expressions can be used to substitute patterns in strings. The `re.sub()` function replaces matches with a replacement string. Example:

```python
import re

# Substitution
pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello, world"
new_text = re.sub(pattern, "hi", text)
print(new_text)  # Output: "hi, world"
```

Slide 12: Splitting The `re.split()` function splits a string based on a regular expression pattern. Example:

```python
import re

# Splitting
pattern = r"[,\s]+"
text = "hello, world, python"
words = re.split(pattern, text)
print(words)  # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'python']
```

Slide 13: Lookaround Lookaround assertions match patterns that are followed or preceded by another pattern, without including the matched pattern in the result. Example:

```python
import re

# Lookahead
pattern = r"(?=hello)"
text = "hello, world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.span())  # Output: (0, 0)
```

Slide 14: Resources and Further Learning Regular expressions can be complex, but there are many resources available for further learning, such as online tutorials, documentation, and books. Example:

```

This slideshow covers the basics of regular expressions in Python, including importing the `re` module, basic patterns, character classes, quantifiers, anchors, groups, alternation, escape sequences, flags, substitution, splitting, and lookaround assertions. It also provides examples and resources for further learning.
