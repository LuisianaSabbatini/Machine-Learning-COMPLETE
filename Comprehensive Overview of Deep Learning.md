## Comprehensive Overview of Deep Learning

Slide 1: What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and extract features from data. It's capable of learning hierarchical representations, allowing it to process complex patterns in data such as images, text, and sound.

Slide 2: Source Code for What is Deep Learning?

```python
import random

class Neuron:
    def __init__(self, inputs):
        self.weights = [random.random() for _ in range(inputs)]
        self.bias = random.random()

    def activate(self, inputs):
        return sum(w * i for w, i in zip(self.weights, inputs)) + self.bias > 0

class DeepNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes):
        self.layers = [[Neuron(inputs) for _ in range(neurons)] 
                       for inputs, neurons in zip(layer_sizes, layer_sizes[1:])]

Slide 4: How Deep Learning Relates to Neural Networks

Deep Learning is built upon the foundation of artificial neural networks. While traditional neural networks might have only one or two hidden layers, deep learning models typically have many more, allowing them to learn more complex representations of data.

Slide 5: Source Code for How Deep Learning Relates to Neural Networks

```python
import math

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))

class DeepNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layer_sizes):
        self.layers = []
        for i in range(1, len(layer_sizes)):
            layer = [[random.random() for _ in range(layer_sizes[i-1])] for _ in range(layer_sizes[i])]
            self.layers.append(layer)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        for layer in self.layers:
            new_inputs = []
            for neuron in layer:
                activation = sum(w * i for w, i in zip(neuron, inputs))
                new_inputs.append(sigmoid(activation))
            inputs = new_inputs

Slide 7: How a Deep Learning Model Works

A deep learning model processes data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer learns to recognize different features of the input data, with deeper layers capturing more abstract and complex patterns. The model adjusts its internal parameters through a process called backpropagation to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

            # Update weights and biases
            for j in range(len(self.weights[i])):
                for k in range(len(self.weights[i][j])):
                    self.weights[i][j][k] += learning_rate * delta[j] * self.activations[i][k]
