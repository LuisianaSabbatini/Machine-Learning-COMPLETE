## Federated Learning with Python Decentralized Machine Learning
Slide 1: Introduction to Federated Learning

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that trains algorithms across decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. This approach addresses privacy concerns and enables learning from diverse data sources.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define a simple model
def create_keras_model():
    return tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

# Wrap the model for federated learning
def model_fn():
    keras_model = create_keras_model()
    return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
        keras_model,
        input_spec=tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 4], dtype=tf.float32),
        loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),
        metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()]
    )
```

Slide 2: Core Principles of Federated Learning

Federated Learning operates on three key principles: local training, model aggregation, and privacy preservation. Clients train models locally, a central server aggregates updates, and raw data never leaves the client devices.

```python
# Simulate federated data
def create_tf_dataset_for_client(client_data):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(client_data)
    return dataset.shuffle(len(client_data)).batch(32)

# Create sample data for two clients
client_data_1 = ({'x': [[1, 2, 3, 4]], 'y': [0]}, {'x': [[2, 3, 4, 5]], 'y': [1]})
client_data_2 = ({'x': [[3, 4, 5, 6]], 'y': [1]}, {'x': [[4, 5, 6, 7]], 'y': [0]})

federated_train_data = [
    create_tf_dataset_for_client(client_data_1),
    create_tf_dataset_for_client(client_data_2)
]
```

Slide 3: Setting Up a Federated Learning Environment

To set up a federated learning environment, we need to define our model, federated data, and learning process. TensorFlow Federated (TFF) provides a framework for implementing federated learning systems.

```python
# Define the federated learning process
iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
    model_fn,
    client_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1),
    server_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1.0)
)

# Initialize the server state
state = iterative_process.initialize()

# Simulate federated learning for a few rounds
NUM_ROUNDS = 5
for round_num in range(NUM_ROUNDS):
    state, metrics = iterative_process.next(state, federated_train_data)
    print(f'Round {round_num+1}, metrics: {metrics}')
```

Slide 4: Client-Side Operations

In federated learning, clients perform local training on their private data. This involves downloading the global model, updating it with local data, and sending only the model updates back to the server.

```python
def client_update(model, dataset):
    # Simulate local training
    for batch in dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            outputs = model(batch['x'])
            loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(batch['y'], outputs)
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1).apply_gradients(
            zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return model.get_weights()

# Example usage
local_model = create_keras_model()
updated_weights = client_update(local_model, federated_train_data[0])
```

Slide 5: Server-Side Aggregation

The server aggregates model updates from multiple clients to improve the global model. This process, often using Federated Averaging (FedAvg), combines client updates without accessing raw data.

```python
def server_aggregate(client_weights):
    # Simple averaging of client model weights
    return [sum(weights) / len(weights) for weights in zip(*client_weights)]

# Simulate server aggregation
client_1_weights = client_update(create_keras_model(), federated_train_data[0])
client_2_weights = client_update(create_keras_model(), federated_train_data[1])
aggregated_weights = server_aggregate([client_1_weights, client_2_weights])

# Update global model
global_model = create_keras_model()
global_model.set_weights(aggregated_weights)
```

Slide 6: Privacy Preservation Techniques

Federated Learning enhances privacy by keeping data local. Additional techniques like differential privacy and secure aggregation further protect individual contributions.

```python
import tensorflow_privacy

def create_dp_optimizer(l2_norm_clip, noise_multiplier, num_microbatches):
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)
    return tensorflow_privacy.DPKerasSGDOptimizer(
        l2_norm_clip=l2_norm_clip,
        noise_multiplier=noise_multiplier,
        num_microbatches=num_microbatches,
        base_optimizer=optimizer
    )

# Usage in the federated learning process
dp_optimizer = create_dp_optimizer(l2_norm_clip=1.0, noise_multiplier=0.1, num_microbatches=1)
```

Slide 7: Communication Efficiency

Efficient communication is crucial in federated learning to reduce bandwidth usage and improve scalability. Techniques like model compression and update sparsification help achieve this goal.

```python
import numpy as np

def compress_weights(weights, compression_ratio=0.1):
    compressed = []
    for w in weights:
        # Keep only the top k% of values
        k = int(w.size * compression_ratio)
        flat = w.flatten()
        idx = np.argpartition(np.abs(flat), -k)[-k:]
        sparse = np.zeros_like(flat)
        sparse[idx] = flat[idx]
        compressed.append(sparse.reshape(w.shape))
    return compressed

# Usage
local_update = client_update(create_keras_model(), federated_train_data[0])
compressed_update = compress_weights(local_update)
```

Slide 8: Handling Non-IID Data

Federated Learning often deals with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across clients. This can lead to challenges in model convergence and performance.

```python
import numpy as np

def create_non_iid_data(num_clients, num_classes):
    data = []
    for _ in range(num_clients):
        # Each client gets data from a subset of classes
        client_classes = np.random.choice(num_classes, size=2, replace=False)
        client_data = []
        for _ in range(100):  # 100 samples per client
            class_ = np.random.choice(client_classes)
            feature = np.random.randn(4)  # 4 features
            client_data.append((feature, class_))
        data.append(client_data)
    return data

non_iid_data = create_non_iid_data(num_clients=5, num_classes=10)
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Healthcare

Federated Learning in healthcare allows hospitals to collaborate on developing diagnostic models without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach respects patient privacy while leveraging diverse medical datasets.

```python
# Simulating a federated learning scenario for medical image classification
def create_medical_model():
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

# Simulate data for two hospitals
hospital_1_data = tf.random.normal((100, 64, 64, 3))  # 100 images
hospital_2_data = tf.random.normal((100, 64, 64, 3))  # 100 images

# Federated training process (simplified)
model = create_medical_model()
for _ in range(5):  # 5 rounds of training
    # Local updates
    model.fit(hospital_1_data, epochs=1)
    model.fit(hospital_2_data, epochs=1)
    # In practice, you'd aggregate these updates on a central server
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Smart Keyboards

Federated Learning powers next-word prediction in smartphone keyboards, improving text suggestions without compromising user privacy. The model learns from user typing patterns while keeping the data on the device.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simplified next-word prediction model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 64, input_length=5),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10000, activation='softmax')
])

# Simulating local training on a user's device
def train_on_device(local_data):
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
    model.fit(local_data, epochs=1, verbose=0)
    return model.get_weights()

# Simulate data for two users
user1_data = tf.random.uniform((100, 5), maxval=10000, dtype=tf.int32)
user2_data = tf.random.uniform((100, 5), maxval=10000, dtype=tf.int32)

# Local training
user1_weights = train_on_device(user1_data)
user2_weights = train_on_device(user2_data)

# In practice, these weights would be sent to a central server for aggregation
```

Slide 11: Challenges in Federated Learning

Federated Learning faces challenges such as communication overhead, client availability, and model personalization. Addressing these issues is crucial for widespread adoption and effectiveness.

```python
import random

def simulate_client_availability(num_clients, availability_rate):
    return [random.random() < availability_rate for _ in range(num_clients)]

def federated_round(clients, availability_rate):
    available_clients = simulate_client_availability(len(clients), availability_rate)
    active_clients = [client for client, available in zip(clients, available_clients) if available]
    
    # Simulate training on active clients
    updates = [client_update(create_keras_model(), client_data) for client_data in active_clients]
    
    # Aggregate updates (simplified)
    aggregated_update = server_aggregate(updates)
    
    return len(active_clients), aggregated_update

# Simulate a federated learning round
num_clients = 10
availability_rate = 0.7
active_clients, _ = federated_round(federated_train_data[:num_clients], availability_rate)
print(f"Active clients in this round: {active_clients}")
```

Slide 12: Model Evaluation in Federated Settings

Evaluating federated models presents unique challenges due to data distribution differences and privacy constraints. Techniques like federated evaluation help assess model performance across diverse client datasets.

```python
def federated_evaluation(model, client_datasets):
    total_samples = 0
    total_loss = 0
    total_accuracy = 0

    for dataset in client_datasets:
        for batch in dataset:
            predictions = model(batch['x'])
            loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(batch['y'], predictions)
            accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.binary_accuracy(batch['y'], predictions)
            
            total_samples += len(batch['y'])
            total_loss += tf.reduce_sum(loss)
            total_accuracy += tf.reduce_sum(accuracy)

    avg_loss = total_loss / total_samples
    avg_accuracy = total_accuracy / total_samples
    return avg_loss.numpy(), avg_accuracy.numpy()

# Evaluate the model
model = create_keras_model()
loss, accuracy = federated_evaluation(model, federated_train_data)
print(f"Federated Evaluation - Loss: {loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 13: Future Directions in Federated Learning

Federated Learning continues to evolve, with ongoing research in areas such as federated transfer learning, multi-task federated learning, and federated reinforcement learning. These advancements promise to expand the applicability and effectiveness of federated systems.

```python
# Simplified example of federated transfer learning
base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), include_top=False)
base_model.trainable = False

def create_transfer_model():
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
    x = base_model(inputs, training=False)
    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
    return tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

# This model could be used in a federated learning setup
transfer_model = create_transfer_model()
```
