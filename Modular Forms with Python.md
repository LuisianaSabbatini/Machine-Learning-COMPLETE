## Modular Forms with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Modular Forms

Modular forms are complex-valued functions with specific symmetry properties. They play a crucial role in number theory, algebraic geometry, and string theory. This slideshow will introduce the basics of modular forms and provide practical examples using Python.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_fundamental_domain():
    x = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 1000)
    y = np.sqrt(1 - x**2)
    plt.plot(x, y, 'b-')
    plt.plot([-1, 1], [0, 0], 'b-')
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.title('Fundamental Domain of SL(2,Z)')
    plt.show()

plot_fundamental_domain()
```

Slide 2: Definition of Modular Forms

A modular form is a holomorphic function f(z) on the upper half-plane that satisfies certain transformation properties under the action of the modular group SL(2,Z). The key property is that for any matrix in SL(2,Z), the function transforms in a specific way.

```python
import sympy as sp

def modular_transformation(z, a, b, c, d):
    return (a*z + b) / (c*z + d)

z = sp.Symbol('z')
a, b, c, d = sp.symbols('a b c d')
transformed_z = modular_transformation(z, a, b, c, d)
print(f"Transformed z: {transformed_z}")
```

Slide 3: Weight of Modular Forms

The weight k of a modular form determines how it transforms under the modular group. For a modular form f of weight k, we have:

f((az + b) / (cz + d)) = (cz + d)^k \* f(z)

```python
def modular_form_transformation(f, z, k, a, b, c, d):
    return (c*z + d)**k * f(modular_transformation(z, a, b, c, d))

# Example with a simple function (not a true modular form)
def example_function(z):
    return z**2

k = 2
result = modular_form_transformation(example_function, z, k, a, b, c, d)
print(f"Transformed function: {result}")
```

Slide 4: Fourier Expansion of Modular Forms

Modular forms have a Fourier expansion, also known as a q-expansion. This expansion is crucial for understanding the arithmetic properties of modular forms.

```python
import sympy as sp

def q_expansion(n_terms):
    q = sp.Symbol('q')
    z = sp.Symbol('z', real=False)
    q = sp.exp(2 * sp.pi * sp.I * z)
    
    expansion = sum(sp.Symbol(f'a_{n}') * q**n for n in range(n_terms))
    return expansion

print(q_expansion(5))
```

Slide 5: Eisenstein Series

Eisenstein series are important examples of modular forms. The Eisenstein series of weight k (for even k ≥ 4) is defined as:

G\_k(z) = ∑\_{(m,n)≠(0,0)} 1 / (mz + n)^k

```python
def eisenstein_series(k, num_terms):
    z = sp.Symbol('z')
    q = sp.exp(2 * sp.pi * sp.I * z)
    
    if k % 2 != 0 or k < 4:
        raise ValueError("k must be even and >= 4")
    
    b_k = -k / (2 * sp.bernoulli(k))
    series = 1 - (2*k/b_k) * sum(sp.divisor_sigma(k-1, n) * q**n for n in range(1, num_terms))
    
    return series

print(eisenstein_series(4, 5))
```

Slide 6: The Discriminant Function Δ

The discriminant function Δ is a weight 12 cusp form that plays a fundamental role in the theory of modular forms. It is defined as:

Δ(z) = q ∏\_{n=1}^∞ (1 - q^n)^24

where q = e^(2πiz)

```python
def discriminant_function(num_terms):
    q = sp.Symbol('q')
    
    product = 1
    for n in range(1, num_terms + 1):
        product *= (1 - q**n)**24
    
    return q * product

print(discriminant_function(5).expand())
```

Slide 7: The j-invariant

The j-invariant is a modular function of weight 0 that generates the field of all modular functions. It is defined in terms of the Eisenstein series E4 and E6:

j(z) = 1728 \* E4(z)^3 / (E4(z)^3 - E6(z)^2)

```python
def j_invariant(num_terms):
    E4 = eisenstein_series(4, num_terms)
    E6 = eisenstein_series(6, num_terms)
    
    j = 1728 * E4**3 / (E4**3 - E6**2)
    return j.expand()

print(j_invariant(5))
```

Slide 8: Theta Functions

Theta functions are special functions that play a crucial role in the theory of modular forms. The most basic theta function is defined as:

θ(z) = ∑\_{n=-∞}^∞ q^(n^2)

where q = e^(πiz)

```python
def theta_function(num_terms):
    q = sp.Symbol('q')
    
    series = sum(q**(n**2) for n in range(-num_terms, num_terms + 1))
    return series

print(theta_function(5))
```

Slide 9: Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves

Modular forms have deep connections to elliptic curves. The modularity theorem states that every elliptic curve over Q is associated with a modular form.

```python
from sympy import EllipticCurve, symbols, expand

def elliptic_curve_l_series(a, b, num_terms):
    E = EllipticCurve(symbols('x'), symbols('y'), 0, a, b)
    q = symbols('q')
    
    L_series = 1 + sum(E.an(n) * q**n for n in range(1, num_terms + 1))
    return expand(L_series)

print(elliptic_curve_l_series(1, 1, 5))
```

Slide 10: Hecke Operators

Hecke operators are linear operators that act on the space of modular forms. They are crucial for understanding the arithmetic properties of modular forms.

```python
def hecke_operator(f, n, k):
    q = sp.Symbol('q')
    result = sum(d**(k-1) * f.subs(q, q**d) for d in sp.divisors(n))
    return result

# Example with a simple q-expansion (not a true modular form)
f = 1 + 24*q + 24*q**2 + 96*q**3 + 24*q**4 + 144*q**5
print(hecke_operator(f, 2, 4))
```

Slide 11: Modular Forms and L-functions

L-functions associated with modular forms encode deep arithmetic information. The Riemann zeta function is a prototypical example of an L-function.

```python
def riemann_zeta_approximation(s, num_terms):
    return sum(1/n**s for n in range(1, num_terms + 1))

s = sp.Symbol('s')
zeta_approx = riemann_zeta_approximation(s, 1000)
print(f"ζ(2) ≈ {zeta_approx.subs(s, 2).evalf()}")
print(f"ζ(3) ≈ {zeta_approx.subs(s, 3).evalf()}")
```

Slide 12: Computational Aspects of Modular Forms

Computing with modular forms often involves working with their q-expansions. Here's an example of how to compute the product of two modular forms:

```python
def multiply_q_expansions(f, g, num_terms):
    q = sp.Symbol('q')
    result = (f * g).expand()
    return sp.Poly(result, q).truncate(num_terms)

# Example with simple q-expansions (not true modular forms)
f = 1 + 24*q + 24*q**2
g = 1 - 24*q + 252*q**2
product = multiply_q_expansions(f, g, 3)
print(f"Product: {product}")
```

Slide 13: Applications of Modular Forms

Modular forms have numerous applications in mathematics and physics. In number theory, they're used to study prime numbers and in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In string theory, they appear in the calculation of scattering amplitudes.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_applications():
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from([
        ("Modular Forms", "Number Theory"),
        ("Modular Forms", "String Theory"),
        ("Modular Forms", "Cryptography"),
        ("Number Theory", "Prime Numbers"),
        ("Number Theory", "Fermat's Last Theorem"),
        ("String Theory", "Scattering Amplitudes")
    ])
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=3000, font_size=8, font_weight='bold')
    plt.title("Applications of Modular Forms")
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

plot_applications()
```

Slide 14: Future Directions and Open Problems

The theory of modular forms continues to evolve, with connections to many areas of mathematics and physics being discovered. Some open problems include the generalization of modularity to higher dimensions and the role of modular forms in quantum gravity.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_venn import venn3

def plot_future_directions():
    set_labels = ('Modular Forms', 'Higher Dimensions', 'Quantum Gravity')
    venn3(subsets=(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), set_labels=set_labels)
    plt.title("Future Directions in Modular Forms")
    plt.show()
