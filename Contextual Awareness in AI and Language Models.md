## Contextual Awareness in AI and Language Models
Slide 1: The Importance of Context in AI and Large Language Models

Context plays a crucial role in the functioning and effectiveness of artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models. It provides the necessary background information and situational awareness that allows these models to generate more accurate, relevant, and coherent responses. Understanding context is essential for developing more sophisticated AI systems that can interpret and respond to human inputs in a meaningful way.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def demonstrate_context_importance(sentence):
    tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
    
    print(f"Sentence: {sentence}")
    print("Part-of-speech tags:")
    for word, tag in pos_tags:
        print(f"{word}: {tag}")

# Example usage
demonstrate_context_importance("The bank is by the river.")
demonstrate_context_importance("I need to bank the check.")
```

Slide 2: Contextual Understanding in Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) relies heavily on context to disambiguate words and phrases with multiple meanings. For instance, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the edge of a river, depending on the surrounding words and the overall context of the sentence. Large language models use contextual information to determine the appropriate meaning and generate coherent responses.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def analyze_context(sentence):
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    
    print(f"Sentence: {sentence}")
    print("Named entities:")
    for ent in doc.ents:
        print(f"{ent.text}: {ent.label_}")
    
    print("\nDependency parsing:")
    for token in doc:
        print(f"{token.text} -> {token.dep_} -> {token.head.text}")

# Example usage
analyze_context("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")
```

Slide 3: Context Windows in Transformer Models

Transformer-based models, which form the backbone of many modern large language models, use a fixed-size context window to process input sequences. This window determines the amount of contextual information available to the model when generating predictions. The size of the context window can significantly impact the model's ability to understand and generate coherent text over longer passages.

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    
    output = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        max_length=max_length,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        no_repeat_ngram_size=2,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return generated_text

# Example usage
prompt = "The context window in transformers"
generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
print(f"Generated text: {generated_text}")
```

Slide 4: Contextual Embeddings

Contextual embeddings are a key component of modern NLP models, allowing words to have different vector representations based on their context. This approach captures the nuanced meanings of words in different situations, improving the model's understanding and generation capabilities. Technologies like BERT and GPT use contextual embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def get_contextual_embeddings(sentence):
    inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
    return last_hidden_states

# Example usage
sentence1 = "The bank by the river is beautiful."
sentence2 = "I need to go to the bank to withdraw money."

embeddings1 = get_contextual_embeddings(sentence1)
embeddings2 = get_contextual_embeddings(sentence2)

print(f"Shape of contextual embeddings for sentence 1: {embeddings1.shape}")
print(f"Shape of contextual embeddings for sentence 2: {embeddings2.shape}")
```

Slide 5: Context-Aware Question Answering

Question answering systems heavily rely on context to provide accurate and relevant answers. By considering the surrounding text and the specific question asked, these systems can extract the most appropriate information from a given passage. This capability is crucial for applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and information retrieval systems.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

def answer_question(context, question):
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    return result['answer']

# Example usage
context = """
The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially
criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it
has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
"""

question = "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"
answer = answer_question(context, question)
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

Slide 6: Context in Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis, the task of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, heavily relies on context. Words and phrases can have different sentiments depending on their surrounding context. Large language models use this contextual information to accurately classify the sentiment of a given text, which is crucial for applications such as social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)[0]
    return result['label'], result['score']

# Example usage
text1 = "The movie was absolutely terrible. I loved every minute of it!"
text2 = "The food was terrible. I couldn't even finish my meal."

sentiment1, score1 = analyze_sentiment(text1)
sentiment2, score2 = analyze_sentiment(text2)

print(f"Text 1: {text1}")
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment1}, Score: {score1:.2f}")
print(f"\nText 2: {text2}")
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment2}, Score: {score2:.2f}")
```

Slide 7: Handling Ambiguity with Context

Natural language is often ambiguous, with words and phrases having multiple possible interpretations. Context plays a crucial role in resolving these ambiguities, allowing AI systems to understand the intended meaning. Large language models use contextual cues to disambiguate words and phrases, improving their overall comprehension and generation capabilities.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.wsd import lesk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt')

def disambiguate_word(sentence, target_word):
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    synset = lesk(tokens, target_word)
    return synset.definition() if synset else "No definition found"

# Example usage
sentence1 = "The bank by the river is eroding."
sentence2 = "I need to go to the bank to deposit some money."

print(f"Sentence 1: {sentence1}")
print(f"Definition of 'bank': {disambiguate_word(sentence1, 'bank')}")

print(f"\nSentence 2: {sentence2}")
print(f"Definition of 'bank': {disambiguate_word(sentence2, 'bank')}")
```

Slide 8: Context-Aware Machine Translation

Machine translation systems benefit significantly from contextual information. By considering the surrounding text and cultural context, these systems can produce more accurate and natural-sounding translations. Large language models use context to handle idiomatic expressions, maintain consistency in gender and number agreement, and choose appropriate words based on the overall meaning of the text.

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

def translate_with_context(text, src_lang, tgt_lang):
    model_name = f'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{src_lang}-{tgt_lang}'
    model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    translated = model.generate(**inputs)
    translated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
    return translated_text

# Example usage
text_en = "I love to play football with my friends."
text_fr = translate_with_context(text_en, "en", "fr")
text_de = translate_with_context(text_en, "en", "de")

print(f"English: {text_en}")
print(f"French: {text_fr}")
print(f"German: {text_de}")
```

Slide 9: Context in Dialogue Systems

Dialogue systems, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, rely heavily on context to maintain coherent and meaningful conversations. These systems need to keep track of previous exchanges, user preferences, and the current topic to generate appropriate responses. Large language models use this contextual information to produce more natural and engaging dialogues.

```python
class DialogueSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context = []
    
    def add_to_context(self, message):
        self.context.append(message)
        if len(self.context) > 5:
            self.context.pop(0)
    
    def generate_response(self, user_input):
        # In a real system, this would use a large language model
        # Here, we'll use a simple rule-based approach for demonstration
        self.add_to_context(f"User: {user_input}")
        
        if "hello" in user_input.lower():
            response = "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
        elif "weather" in user_input.lower():
            response = "I'm sorry, I don't have access to real-time weather information. Is there anything else I can help with?"
        elif "bye" in user_input.lower():
            response = "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
        else:
            response = "I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you please rephrase or ask something else?"
        
        self.add_to_context(f"Assistant: {response}")
        return response

# Example usage
dialogue_system = DialogueSystem()

print(dialogue_system.generate_response("Hello there!"))
print(dialogue_system.generate_response("What's the weather like today?"))
print(dialogue_system.generate_response("Goodbye!"))

print("\nContext:")
for message in dialogue_system.context:
    print(message)
```

Slide 10: Context in Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning is a technique where models can learn new tasks with only a few examples. Context plays a crucial role in this process, as the model uses the contextual information from the provided examples to understand the task and generate appropriate responses. This capability allows large language models to adapt to new scenarios and tasks without extensive retraining.

```python
def few_shot_learning(task_description, examples, new_input):
    prompt = f"{task_description}\n\nExamples:\n"
    
    for input_text, output_text in examples:
        prompt += f"Input: {input_text}\nOutput: {output_text}\n\n"
    
    prompt += f"Input: {new_input}\nOutput:"
    
    # In a real system, this would use a large language model to generate the output
    # Here, we'll just return the prompt to show how it's constructed
    return prompt

# Example usage
task_description = "Translate English to French"
examples = [
    ("Hello", "Bonjour"),
    ("How are you?", "Comment allez-vous ?"),
    ("Goodbye", "Au revoir")
]
new_input = "Good morning"

prompt = few_shot_learning(task_description, examples, new_input)
print(prompt)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Context-Aware Autocomplete

One common application of context-aware AI is in autocomplete systems used in text editors and search engines. These systems use the surrounding text and user behavior to suggest relevant words or phrases, improving typing speed and accuracy. Large language models leverage contextual information to provide more accurate and helpful suggestions.

```python
import random

class ContextAwareAutocomplete:
    def __init__(self):
        self.word_frequencies = {
            "the": 100, "be": 90, "to": 80, "of": 70, "and": 60,
            "a": 50, "in": 40, "that": 30, "have": 20, "I": 10
        }
        self.bigrams = {
            "the": ["quick", "brown", "lazy"],
            "brown": ["fox", "dog", "bear"],
            "lazy": ["dog", "cat", "sloth"]
        }
    
    def suggest_next_word(self, current_word, prev_word=None):
        if prev_word and prev_word in self.bigrams:
            suggestions = self.bigrams[prev_word]
        else:
            suggestions = sorted(self.word_frequencies, key=self.word_frequencies.get, reverse=True)[:3]
        
        return suggestions

# Example usage
autocomplete = ContextAwareAutocomplete()

print(autocomplete.suggest_next_word("t"))  # Suggests based on frequency
print(autocomplete.suggest_next_word("brown", "the"))  # Suggests based on context
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Context-Aware Image Captioning

Image captioning systems use context from both the image and the surrounding text to generate accurate and relevant captions. These systems combine computer vision techniques with natural language processing to understand the content of an image and describe it in natural language. Large language models use this contextual information to produce more detailed and coherent captions.

```python
from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTImageProcessor, AutoTokenizer
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
feature_extractor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

def caption_image(image_url):
    image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)
    pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=[image], return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
    pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)

    output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, max_length=16, num_beams=4, return_dict_in_generate=True).sequences
    preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
    return preds[0].strip()

# Example usage
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Cute_dog.jpg/640px-Cute_dog.jpg"
caption = caption_image(image_url)
print(f"Generated caption: {caption}")
```

Slide 13: Challenges and Limitations of Context in AI

While context is crucial for improving AI performance, there are challenges and limitations to consider. These include:

1. Context window size: Large language models have a fixed context window, limiting the amount of information they can process at once.
2. Computational complexity: Processing longer contexts requires more computational resources and time.
3. Relevance determination: Identifying which parts of the context are most relevant for a given task can be challenging.
4. Bias and misinformation: Contextual information may introduce biases or perpetuate misinformation if not carefully curated.
5. Privacy concerns: Storing and using extensive contextual information may raise privacy issues.

Slide 14: Challenges and Limitations of Context in AI

```python
import numpy as np

class ContextWindowSimulator:
    def __init__(self, window_size):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.context = []
    
    def add_token(self, token):
        if len(self.context) >= self.window_size:
            self.context.pop(0)
        self.context.append(token)
    
    def get_context(self):
        return self.context
    
    def compute_complexity(self):
        return np.power(len(self.context), 2)  # Simplified complexity model

# Example usage
simulator = ContextWindowSimulator(5)
tokens = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]

for token in tokens:
    simulator.add_token(token)
    print(f"Current context: {simulator.get_context()}")
    print(f"Computational complexity: {simulator.compute_complexity()}\n")
```

Slide 15: Future Directions in Context-Aware AI

As AI continues to evolve, researchers are exploring new ways to improve contextual understanding and leverage it more effectively. Some promising directions include:

1. Adaptive context windows that can dynamically adjust based on the task requirements.
2. Multi-modal context integration, combining textual, visual, and auditory information.
3. Hierarchical context modeling to capture both local and global contextual information.
4. Improved techniques for long-term memory and retrieval in AI systems.
5. Development of more efficient algorithms for processing and utilizing large amounts of contextual data.

Slide 16: Future Directions in Context-Aware AI

```python
class AdaptiveContextWindow:
    def __init__(self, min_size, max_size):
        self.min_size = min_size
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.current_size = min_size
        self.context = []
    
    def adjust_window_size(self, complexity):
        # Adjust window size based on task complexity
        self.current_size = min(max(self.min_size, complexity), self.max_size)
    
    def add_token(self, token):
        if len(self.context) >= self.current_size:
            self.context = self.context[-(self.current_size - 1):]
        self.context.append(token)
    
    def get_context(self):
        return self.context

# Example usage
adaptive_window = AdaptiveContextWindow(3, 10)
tokens = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
complexities = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5]

for token, complexity in zip(tokens, complexities):
    adaptive_window.adjust_window_size(complexity)
    adaptive_window.add_token(token)
    print(f"Complexity: {complexity}")
    print(f"Window size: {adaptive_window.current_size}")
    print(f"Context: {adaptive_window.get_context()}\n")
```
