## Visual Guide to Active Learning in Machine Learning

Slide 1: Introduction to Active Learning in Machine Learning

Active learning is a machine learning approach that interactively queries a user or other information source to label new data points. This method is particularly useful when dealing with unlabeled datasets, as it allows for efficient and targeted labeling of the most informative examples. Active learning aims to achieve high accuracy with a minimal amount of labeled training data, making it a cost-effective solution for many real-world applications.

Slide 2: Source Code for Introduction to Active Learning in Machine Learning

```python
import random

class ActiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, unlabeled_data):
        self.labeled_data = []
        self.unlabeled_data = unlabeled_data
        self.model = None

    def initialize_seed(self, num_samples=10):
        # Randomly select initial samples for labeling
        seed_samples = random.sample(self.unlabeled_data, num_samples)
        for sample in seed_samples:
            label = self.query_oracle(sample)
            self.labeled_data.append((sample, label))
            self.unlabeled_data.remove(sample)

    def query_oracle(self, sample):
        # Simulating human labeling
        return input(f"Please label this sample ({sample}): ")

    def train_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model training
        print("Training model with", len(self.labeled_data), "labeled samples")
        self.model = "Trained Model"

    def predict(self, sample):
        # Placeholder for model prediction
        return random.random()  # Returns a confidence score between 0 and 1

    def select_samples(self, num_samples=5):
        # Select samples with lowest confidence for labeling
        predictions = [(sample, self.predict(sample)) for sample in self.unlabeled_data]
        sorted_predictions = sorted(predictions, key=lambda x: x[1])
        return [sample for sample, _ in sorted_predictions[:num_samples]]

    def active_learning_loop(self, iterations=5):
        for _ in range(iterations):
            self.train_model()
            samples_to_label = self.select_samples()
            for sample in samples_to_label:
                label = self.query_oracle(sample)
                self.labeled_data.append((sample, label))
                self.unlabeled_data.remove(sample)

# Example usage
unlabeled_data = [f"Sample_{i}" for i in range(100)]
learner = ActiveLearner(unlabeled_data)
learner.initialize_seed()
learner.active_learning_loop()
```

Slide 3: The Active Learning Process

The active learning process involves several key steps:

1.  Initial seed labeling: A small subset of the unlabeled data is manually labeled to create an initial training set.
2.  Model training: A machine learning model is trained on the currently labeled data.
3.  Prediction and confidence estimation: The model generates predictions and confidence scores for the remaining unlabeled data.
4.  Sample selection: Samples with the lowest confidence scores are selected for labeling.
5.  Oracle querying: The selected samples are presented to a human expert (oracle) for labeling.
6.  Iteration: Steps 2-5 are repeated until a satisfactory model performance is achieved or a labeling budget is exhausted.

This iterative process allows the model to focus on the most informative examples, improving its performance efficiently.

Slide 4: Source Code for The Active Learning Process

```python
import random

def simulate_oracle(sample):
    # Simulates a human expert labeling a sample
    return random.choice(["positive", "negative"])

def train_model(labeled_data):
    # Placeholder for model training
    print(f"Training model with {len(labeled_data)} samples")
    return "Trained Model"

def predict_with_confidence(model, sample):
    # Placeholder for model prediction with confidence
    return random.random()

def active_learning_process(unlabeled_data, initial_seed_size=10, iterations=5, samples_per_iteration=5):
    labeled_data = []
    
    # Step 1: Initial seed labeling
    for _ in range(initial_seed_size):
        sample = unlabeled_data.pop()
        label = simulate_oracle(sample)
        labeled_data.append((sample, label))
    
    for iteration in range(iterations):
        # Step 2: Model training
        model = train_model(labeled_data)
        
        # Step 3: Prediction and confidence estimation
        confidences = [(sample, predict_with_confidence(model, sample)) for sample in unlabeled_data]
        
        # Step 4: Sample selection
        selected_samples = sorted(confidences, key=lambda x: x[1])[:samples_per_iteration]
        
        # Step 5: Oracle querying
        for sample, _ in selected_samples:
            label = simulate_oracle(sample)
            labeled_data.append((sample, label))
            unlabeled_data.remove(sample)
        
        print(f"Iteration {iteration + 1}: Labeled {len(labeled_data)} samples")
    
    return labeled_data, train_model(labeled_data)

# Example usage
unlabeled_data = [f"Sample_{i}" for i in range(1000)]
final_labeled_data, final_model = active_learning_process(unlabeled_data)
print(f"Final labeled data size: {len(final_labeled_data)}")
```

Slide 5: Uncertainty Sampling

Uncertainty sampling is a common strategy in active learning for selecting the most informative samples. This method chooses instances about which the current model is least certain. For classification tasks, uncertainty can be measured using metrics such as entropy or the difference between the top two class probabilities. By focusing on uncertain samples, the model can quickly improve its decision boundaries and overall performance.

Slide 6: Source Code for Uncertainty Sampling

```python
import math
import random

def entropy(probabilities):
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0)

def margin_sampling(probabilities):
    sorted_probs = sorted(probabilities, reverse=True)
    return sorted_probs[0] - sorted_probs[1]

class UncertaintySampler:
    def __init__(self, strategy='entropy'):
        self.strategy = strategy
    
    def get_uncertainty(self, probabilities):
        if self.strategy == 'entropy':
            return entropy(probabilities)
        elif self.strategy == 'margin':
            return -margin_sampling(probabilities)  # Negative so that higher values indicate more uncertainty
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown uncertainty strategy")

    def select_samples(self, unlabeled_data, model, k):
        uncertainties = []
        for sample in unlabeled_data:
            probabilities = model.predict_proba(sample)  # Assume model has this method
            uncertainty = self.get_uncertainty(probabilities)
            uncertainties.append((sample, uncertainty))
        
        sorted_samples = sorted(uncertainties, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return [sample for sample, _ in sorted_samples[:k]]

# Example usage
def mock_model_predict_proba(sample):
    # Mock function to simulate model predictions
    return [random.random() for _ in range(3)]

class MockModel:
    def predict_proba(self, sample):
        probs = mock_model_predict_proba(sample)
        return [p / sum(probs) for p in probs]  # Normalize to ensure sum is 1

unlabeled_data = [f"Sample_{i}" for i in range(100)]
model = MockModel()
sampler = UncertaintySampler(strategy='entropy')
selected_samples = sampler.select_samples(unlabeled_data, model, k=5)

print("Selected samples:", selected_samples)
```

Slide 7: Query-by-Committee

Query-by-Committee (QBC) is an active learning approach that uses multiple models (a committee) to select the most informative samples. Each committee member votes on the classification of unlabeled instances, and the samples with the highest disagreement among committee members are selected for labeling. This method helps to explore different regions of the hypothesis space and can lead to more robust models.

Slide 8: Source Code for Query-by-Committee

```python
import random
from collections import Counter

class CommitteeMember:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def predict(self, sample):
        # Simulate prediction (in reality, this would be a trained model)
        return random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'])

class QueryByCommittee:
    def __init__(self, committee_members):
        self.committee = committee_members
    
    def vote(self, sample):
        return [member.predict(sample) for member in self.committee]
    
    def disagreement(self, votes):
        vote_counts = Counter(votes)
        most_common = vote_counts.most_common(1)[0][1]
        return 1 - (most_common / len(votes))
    
    def select_samples(self, unlabeled_data, k):
        sample_disagreements = []
        for sample in unlabeled_data:
            votes = self.vote(sample)
            disagreement = self.disagreement(votes)
            sample_disagreements.append((sample, disagreement))
        
        sorted_samples = sorted(sample_disagreements, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return [sample for sample, _ in sorted_samples[:k]]

# Example usage
committee_members = [CommitteeMember(f"Model_{i}") for i in range(5)]
qbc = QueryByCommittee(committee_members)

unlabeled_data = [f"Sample_{i}" for i in range(100)]
selected_samples = qbc.select_samples(unlabeled_data, k=5)

print("Selected samples:", selected_samples)
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Text Classification

Active learning is particularly useful in text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or spam detection. In these scenarios, labeling large amounts of text data can be time-consuming and expensive. By using active learning, we can focus on labeling the most informative examples, allowing us to build effective classifiers with minimal human effort.

Slide 10: Source Code for Text Classification Example

```python
import random
from collections import Counter

class TextClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.word_counts = Counter()
        self.class_counts = Counter()
    
    def train(self, labeled_data):
        for text, label in labeled_data:
            words = text.lower().split()
            self.word_counts.update(words)
            self.class_counts[label] += 1
    
    def predict_proba(self, text):
        words = text.lower().split()
        class_scores = {c: 1 for c in self.class_counts.keys()}
        
        for word in words:
            for class_ in class_scores:
                if word in self.word_counts:
                    class_scores[class_] *= (self.word_counts[word] + 1) / (self.class_counts[class_] + len(self.word_counts))
        
        total = sum(class_scores.values())
        return {c: s/total for c, s in class_scores.items()}

def entropy(probabilities):
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities.values() if p > 0)

class ActiveTextLearner:
    def __init__(self, unlabeled_data):
        self.labeled_data = []
        self.unlabeled_data = unlabeled_data
        self.model = TextClassifier()
    
    def query_oracle(self, text):
        # Simulating human labeling
        return input(f"Please label this text (positive/negative): {text}\n")
    
    def select_sample(self):
        max_entropy = -1
        selected_sample = None
        
        for sample in self.unlabeled_data:
            probs = self.model.predict_proba(sample)
            sample_entropy = entropy(probs)
            if sample_entropy > max_entropy:
                max_entropy = sample_entropy
                selected_sample = sample
        
        return selected_sample
    
    def active_learning_loop(self, iterations=5):
        for _ in range(iterations):
            sample = self.select_sample()
            label = self.query_oracle(sample)
            self.labeled_data.append((sample, label))
            self.unlabeled_data.remove(sample)
            self.model.train(self.labeled_data)
            print(f"Iteration complete. Labeled data size: {len(self.labeled_data)}")

# Example usage
unlabeled_data = [
    "This product is amazing!",
    "I hate this service.",
    "The quality is okay.",
    "Worst experience ever.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "Not sure how I feel about this.",
    "Could be better.",
    "Absolutely love it!",
    "Never buying this again.",
    "Mixed feelings about the results."
]

learner = ActiveTextLearner(unlabeled_data)
learner.active_learning_loop()
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Active learning is also valuable in image classification tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets or specialized domains where expert annotation is required. For instance, in medical imaging, active learning can help prioritize the most challenging or ambiguous cases for expert review, improving the efficiency of the labeling process and the overall model performance.

Slide 12: Source Code for Image Classification Example

```python
import random
from collections import Counter

class MockImageClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classes = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
    
    def predict_proba(self, image):
        # Simulate prediction probabilities
        probs = [random.random() for _ in self.classes]
        total = sum(probs)
        return {c: p/total for c, p in zip(self.classes, probs)}

def entropy(probabilities):
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities.values() if p > 0)

class ActiveImageLearner:
    def __init__(self, unlabeled_images):
        self.labeled_images = []
        self.unlabeled_images = unlabeled_images
        self.model = MockImageClassifier()
    
    def query_oracle(self, image):
        # Simulating expert labeling
        return input(f"Please label this image (dog/cat/bird): {image}\n")
    
    def select_sample(self):
        max_entropy = -1
        selected_sample = None
        
        for image in self.unlabeled_images:
            probs = self.model.predict_proba(image)
            image_entropy = entropy(probs)
            if image_entropy > max_entropy:
                max_entropy = image_entropy
                selected_sample = image
        
        return selected_sample
    
    def active_learning_loop(self, iterations=5):
        for i in range(iterations):
            sample = self.select_sample()
            label = self.query_oracle(sample)
            self.labeled_images.append((sample, label))
            self.unlabeled_images.remove(sample)
            print(f"Iteration {i+1} complete. Labeled images: {len(self.labeled_images)}")

# Example usage
unlabeled_images = [f"image_{i}.jpg" for i in range(100)]
learner = ActiveImageLearner(unlabeled_images)
learner.active_learning_loop()
```

Slide 13: Challenges and Considerations in Active Learning

While active learning offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges:

1.  Cold start problem: Initially, the model may not have enough information to make informed decisions about which samples to query.
2.  Sampling bias: The active learning process may introduce bias by focusing on certain types of examples.
3.  Batch mode vs. stream-based learning: Deciding whether to label samples in batches or one at a time can affect efficiency and model performance.
4.  Stopping criteria: Determining when to stop the active learning process is crucial for balancing performance and labeling effort.
5.  Human factors: The quality and consistency of human annotations can impact the effectiveness of active learning.

Addressing these challenges is essential for successful implementation of active learning in real-world scenarios.
