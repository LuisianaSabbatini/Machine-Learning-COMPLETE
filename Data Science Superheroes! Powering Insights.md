import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Define components of data science
components = ['Mathematics', 'Computer Science', 'Statistics', 'Domain Knowledge', 'Communication']
importance = [0.25, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15]

# Create a pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.pie(importance, labels=components, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title('Components of Data Science')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

# Generate a large random array
arr = np.random.randint(0, 1000, 10000)

# Measure sorting time
start_time = time.time()
bubble_sort(arr)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken to sort 10,000 elements: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 4: Statistics in Data Science

Statistics plays a crucial role in data science by providing methods to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data. It helps in making inferences, testing hypotheses, and quantifying uncertainty.

# Generate two datasets
group1 = np.random.normal(5, 2, 1000)
group2 = np.random.normal(6, 2, 1000)

# Perform t-test
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("There is a significant difference between the two groups.")
else:
    print("There is no significant difference between the two groups.")
```

Slide 5: Domain Knowledge in Data Science

Domain knowledge is essential in data science as it provides context and understanding of the specific field in which data analysis is being applied.

data = pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data['age'].fillna(data['age'].mean(), inplace=True)
data['income'].fillna(data['income'].median(), inplace=True)

# Remove duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Normalize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_features = ['age', 'income', 'credit_score']
data[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(data[numerical_features])

print(data.head())
print(f"\nShape of cleaned dataset: {data.shape}")
```

Slide 8: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in understanding the characteristics and patterns within a dataset. It involves using statistical and visualization techniques to summarize main features, identify relationships between variables, and detect anomalies or outliers. EDA helps in forming hypotheses and guiding further analysis.

from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1) / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1) / 255.0

# Build a simple CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

})

# Check for potential bias
bias_check = data.groupby('gender')['approved'].mean()
print("Approval rates by gender:")
print(bias_check)

# Calculate overall approval rate
overall_rate = data['approved'].mean()

# Calculate disparate impact ratio
impact_ratio = bias_check / overall_rate
print("\nDisparate Impact Ratio:")
print(impact_ratio)

# Check for significant disparity
threshold = 0.8
if any(impact_ratio < threshold) or any(impact_ratio > 1/threshold):
    print("\nPotential bias detected. Further investigation needed.")
else:
    print("\nNo significant disparity detected based on the 80% rule.")
```
