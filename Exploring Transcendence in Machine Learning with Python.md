model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print model summary
model.summary()
```

Slide 3: Deep Learning: Unlocking Transcendent Capabilities

epsilon = 0.1
episodes = 1000

# Initialize Q-table
q_table = np.zeros([env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n])

for episode in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        if np.random.random() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            action = np.argmax(q_table[state])
        
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Update Q-table
        q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] + learning_rate * (
            reward + discount_factor * np.max(q_table[next_state]) - q_table[state, action]
        )
        
        state = next_state

base_model.trainable = False

# Add custom layers for new task
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the new model
new_model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42).fit(X, y)

# Compute SHAP values
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

# Visualize SHAP values for a single prediction
shap.initjs()
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0], X[0])

# Summary plot of feature importance
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, plot_type="bar")
```

Slide 10: Ethical Considerations in Transcendent AI

As AI systems surpass human abilities, ethical considerations become paramount. Issues such as bias, fairness, and transparency must be addressed to ensure that transcendent AI benefits all of humanity.

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Simulated dataset with potential bias
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 5)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 1).astype(int)  # Decision based on first two features
sensitive_attribute = (X[:, 4] > 0.5).astype(int)  # Last feature as sensitive attribute

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)

# Evaluate fairness
predictions = model.predict(X)
conf_matrix_0 = confusion_matrix(y[sensitive_attribute == 0], predictions[sensitive_attribute == 0])
conf_matrix_1 = confusion_matrix(y[sensitive_attribute == 1], predictions[sensitive_attribute == 1])

print("Confusion matrix for group 0:")
print(conf_matrix_0)
print("\nConfusion matrix for group 1:")
print(conf_matrix_1)

# Calculate and compare false positive rates
fpr_0 = conf_matrix_0[0, 1] / (conf_matrix_0[0, 0] + conf_matrix_0[0, 1])
fpr_1 = conf_matrix_1[0, 1] / (conf_matrix_1[0, 0] + conf_matrix_1[0, 1])

print(f"\nFalse Positive Rate difference: {abs(fpr_0 - fpr_1):.4f}")
```

base_model = DenseNet121(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add custom layers for chest X-ray classification
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(x)  # 2 classes: normal and pneumonia

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print model summary
model.summary()

# Note: In practice, you would train this model on a large dataset of chest X-rays
# and evaluate its performance against human radiologists
```

model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(time_steps, features), return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(32),
    Dense(features)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = set()
    
    def learn(self, fact):
        self.knowledge_base.add(fact)
    
    def reason(self, question):
        if question in self.knowledge_base:
            return "I know this fact."
        elif random.random() < 0.5:  # Simulate limited reasoning ability
            return "I can infer this based on my knowledge."
        else:
            return "I don't know and cannot infer this information."

# Create an AI agent
agent = AIAgent()

# Teach the agent some facts
agent.learn("The sky is blue")
agent.learn("Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen")

# Test the agent's reasoning
questions = [
    "The sky is blue",
    "Water is wet",
