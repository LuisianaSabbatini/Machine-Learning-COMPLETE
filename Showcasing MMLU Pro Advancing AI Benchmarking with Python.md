```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data for MMLU and MMLU Pro scores
models = ['Model A', 'Model B', 'Model C']
mmlu_scores = [75, 80, 85]
mmlu_pro_scores = [70, 78, 82]

# Create a bar chart comparing MMLU and MMLU Pro scores
x = np.arange(len(models))
width = 0.35

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.bar(x - width/2, mmlu_scores, width, label='MMLU')
ax.bar(x + width/2, mmlu_pro_scores, width, label='MMLU Pro')

ax.set_ylabel('Scores')
ax.set_title('MMLU vs MMLU Pro Scores')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(models)
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Key Differences Between MMLU and MMLU Pro

MMLU Pro builds upon the original MMLU benchmark by introducing more complex tasks, interdisciplinary questions, and a focus on real-world problem-solving. It aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of AI models' capabilities in handling diverse and challenging scenarios.

    mmlu_complexity = {
        'basic': 1,
        'intermediate': 2,
        'advanced': 3
    }
    
    mmlu_pro_complexity = {
        'basic': 2,
        'intermediate': 3,
        'advanced': 4,
        'expert': 5
    }
    
    print(f"Task: {task}")
    print(f"MMLU Complexity: {mmlu_complexity.get(task, 'Not available')}")
    print(f"MMLU Pro Complexity: {mmlu_pro_complexity.get(task, 'Not available')}")

# Example usage
compare_benchmarks('intermediate')
compare_benchmarks('expert')
```

        self.category = category
        self.difficulty = difficulty

    def generate_question(self):
        # Simplified question generation
        questions = [
            f"Explain the concept of {random.choice(['quantum entanglement', 'neural networks', 'climate change'])}.",
            f"Analyze the impact of {random.choice(['globalization', 'artificial intelligence', 'social media'])} on society.",
            f"Solve the following problem: {random.randint(1, 100)} + {random.randint(1, 100)} = ?"
        ]
        return random.choice(questions)

# Create a task and generate a question
task = MMMLUProTask("Interdisciplinary", "Advanced")
print(f"Category: {task.category}")
print(f"Difficulty: {task.difficulty}")
print(f"Question: {task.generate_question()}")
```

Slide 4: Interdisciplinary Evaluation in MMLU Pro

One of the key features of MMLU Pro is its emphasis on interdisciplinary evaluation. This approach assesses an AI model's ability to integrate knowledge from multiple domains and apply it to complex problem-solving scenarios.

        "regulatory requirements",
        "public opinion concerns",
    ]
    
    scenario = random.choice(scenarios)
    constraint1, constraint2 = random.sample(constraints, 2)
    
    problem = f"Problem: {scenario}\n"
    problem += f"Constraints: {constraint1} and {constraint2}\n"
    problem += "Propose a solution that addresses the problem while considering the given constraints."
    
    return problem

# Generate and print a real-world problem
print(generate_real_world_problem())
```

Slide 6: Adaptive Difficulty in MMLU Pro

MMLU Pro introduces an adaptive difficulty system that adjusts the complexity of questions based on the model's performance. This feature ensures a more accurate assessment of an AI model's capabilities across different skill levels.

```python
import random

class AdaptiveDifficultySystem:
    def __init__(self, initial_difficulty=5):
        self.difficulty = initial_difficulty
        self.correct_answers = 0
        self.total_questions = 0

    def adjust_difficulty(self, is_correct):
        self.total_questions += 1
        if is_correct:
            self.correct_answers += 1
            self.difficulty = min(10, self.difficulty + 0.5)
        else:
            self.difficulty = max(1, self.difficulty - 0.5)

    def get_question(self):
        # Simplified question generation based on difficulty
        return f"Question with difficulty {self.difficulty:.1f}"

    def get_performance(self):
        return self.correct_answers / self.total_questions if self.total_questions > 0 else 0

# Simulate adaptive difficulty system
ads = AdaptiveDifficultySystem()
for _ in range(10):
    question = ads.get_question()
    print(question)
    is_correct = random.choice([True, False])
    ads.adjust_difficulty(is_correct)

print(f"Final difficulty: {ads.difficulty:.1f}")

        "In a formal business meeting",
        "During a casual conversation between friends",
        "In a scientific research paper",
        "As part of a stand-up comedy routine"
    ]
    
    phrases = [
        "That's cool",
        "I'm fine",
        "It's a piece of cake",
        "Break a leg"
    ]
    
    context = random.choice(contexts)
    phrase = random.choice(phrases)
    
    question = f"Context: {context}\n"
    question += f"Phrase: \"{phrase}\"\n\n"
    question += "Analyze the potential meanings and interpretations of this phrase in the given context. "
    question += "Consider tone, intent, and any potential misunderstandings that could arise."
    
    return question

# Generate and print a contextual understanding question
print(generate_contextual_question())
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Environmental Impact Assessment
