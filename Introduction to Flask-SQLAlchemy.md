## Introduction to Flask-SQLAlchemy

Slide 1: Introduction to Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). It simplifies the process of working with databases in Flask applications.

Slide 2: Setting up Flask-SQLAlchemy To use Flask-SQLAlchemy, you need to install it and create a database connection.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///database.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

Slide 3: Creating a Model Models represent database tables. Here's an example of a simple User model.

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'User({self.username}, {self.email})'
```

Slide 4: Database Operations (Create, Read) Flask-SQLAlchemy provides methods to perform CRUD operations on models.

```python
# Create a new user
user = User(username='john', email='john@example.com')
db.session.add(user)
db.session.commit()

# Read users
users = User.query.all()
```

Slide 5: Database Operations (Update, Delete) Here's how to update and delete records using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

```python
# Update a user
user = User.query.filter_by(username='john').first()
user.email = 'newemail@example.com'
db.session.commit()

# Delete a user
user = User.query.filter_by(username='john').first()
db.session.delete(user)
db.session.commit()
```

Slide 6: Database Relationships Flask-SQLAlchemy supports defining relationships between models, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

```python
class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    body = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    user = db.relationship('User', backref=db.backref('posts', lazy=True))
```

Slide 7: Querying with Filters and Joins Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a powerful query language for filtering and joining data.

```python
# Filter posts by user
user = User.query.filter_by(username='john').first()
posts = user.posts

# Join tables
posts = db.session.query(Post, User).join(User).all()
```

Slide 8: Database Migrations Flask-Migrate is an extension that handles database migrations, allowing you to manage changes to your database schema.

```python
from flask_migrate import Migrate

migrate = Migrate(app, db)

# Run migrations
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

Slide 9: SQL Injection Prevention To prevent SQL injection attacks, Flask-SQLAlchemy uses parameterized queries, which separate the SQL statement from the data. Flask-SQLAlchemy automatically handles this for you, so you don't need to do anything special to prevent SQL injection.

```python
# This code is safe from SQL injection
username = "john_doe"
user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
```

Slide 10: Pagination and Limiting Results Flask-SQLAlchemy provides methods to paginate and limit query results, which can improve performance and prevent excessive data retrieval.

```python
# Pagination
page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)
posts = Post.query.paginate(page=page, per_page=10)

# Limiting results
limited_posts = Post.query.limit(5).all()
```

Slide 11: Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Admin Flask-Admin is an extension that provides a user interface for managing databases and models in Flask-SQLAlchemy applications.

```python
from flask_admin import Admin
from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView

admin = Admin(app)
admin.add_view(ModelView(User, db.session))
admin.add_view(ModelView(Post, db.session))
```

Slide 12: Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Security Flask-Security is an extension that provides authentication, authorization, and user management features for Flask-SQLAlchemy applications.

```python
from flask_security import Security, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore

user_datastore = SQLAlchemyUserDatastore(db, User, Role)
security = Security(app, user_datastore)
```
